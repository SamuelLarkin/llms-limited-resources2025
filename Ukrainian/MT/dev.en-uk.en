"Tierra del Sol is pleased to present ""Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water"" at the new gallery location in West Hollywood. Siso has been an artist in the Studio Arts Program since 2012, this marks his debut solo exhibition. Siso was born 1962 in Madrid and raised between Venezuela, Trinidad and Miami; he moved with his family to Southern California in his early 20s."
"Masterfully working across subject matter, Siso has generated a prolific series of landscapes, portraits, and still-life works rendered in either acrylic, pastel, pencil or watercolor. Drawing from family portraits, his own reference photographs, and recollection, his colorful compositions demonstrate his range of interests and skill across media. Siso's tropical landscapes and seascapes reflect the geographies of his past, employing rich patterns and incorporating people to make meaningful connections between culture, memory and the environment. Siso titles his artworks in a mix of Spanish and English, signifying the celebrated and integral complexities of his life in Los Angeles County. ""Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water"" opens on Saturday, Jan. 13, with a reception from 6-8 p.m. The exhibition is on view through Sunday, March 3."

"Adapt the old, accommodate the new to solve issue"
"At the precinct level, we just need to look at the Sydney CBD as an example of an area which has grown from its pre-settlement landscape into a two-storey city, from a maximum height of 150 feet to the soaring towers of today. At a much scaled-down level, the same can occur across Sydney's town centres located around transport nodes. Inner suburbs must also evolve, with a swing to more affordable apartment living at heights below the tree tops on key sites. Of course, the new growth in housing needs to be well-designed and trees, landscaping and parks need to be included along with other essential infrastructure."
"Our planning system also needs to adapt so that planners in suburban councils, who seem to be less supportive of change, are not the only determinants of the future shape of their suburbs. A way forward could be to have an independent decision-making body that championed quality design as long as it fitted below the tree tops and incorporated family living, large balconies, common gardens and presented a friendly appearance. This could be a role for the current NSW government architect working within a carefully crafted complying code."
"Over the past decade, our lives have changed through technology, with many working from home, and Sydney has gained an impressive network of metro and light rail systems. Our ability to purchase online has changed the way we shop, and friends and family seem closer because of smartphone communication. All of these adaptations from one system to another can also occur in our built environment through a planning focus on adaptive reuse rather than preferencing heritage preservation."
"Chris Johnson is a former NSW government architect (1995-2005) and executive director, NSW Department of Planning (2005-2009). He was CEO of Urban Taskforce Australia between 2011 and 2019."
A final push for female equality
"Last year, the World Economic Forum forecast that it would take five generations to achieve gender equality in every nation. Now the World Bank wants to rapidly accelerate that time frame."
"The international financial institution is poised to launch a strategy aimed at significantly advancing the rights and economic opportunities for girls and women by 2030. The plan focuses on improving inclusivity and resilience through access to finance, technological innovation, and changes in public policy and law."
"""Recent research demonstrates that both social norms and mindsets can change, for example, that engaging men and boys can foster their support and buy-in for gender equality,"" a consultative draft of the plan states. ""Positive gender outcomes can be accelerated and scaled with a better understanding of ... how social norms and mindsets shape everyday expectations, priorities, and practices."""
"Shifts in thought are harder to quantify than bank loans for rural women or school enrollment for girls. Yet there is plenty of evidence that female agency can move mountains. In Iran, for example, women have led the greatest threat to the Islamic government in 40 years simply by refusing to comply with laws that force them to cover their hair. In some of the 130 countries with minimum quotas for female representation in government, such as India, male resistance to female voting and political activism has eased."
"In some rural African communities, civil society organizations are replacing a harmful rite of passage with health education. One such program helped Kamanda Timayio, leader of the Masai village of Maparasha, Kenya, change his mind about female genital mutilation. He told Le Monde that he had ""emerged from ignorance"" and would abandon the practice."
"The World Bank cites other examples. From 1970 to 2022, Bangladesh quadrupled female literacy rates and doubled female participation in the labor force. Its gross domestic product more than tripled. The change gathered its own momentum. Recruiting salaried women as teachers and health workers from within their own communities boosted trust ""and made women's mobility and work more socially acceptable."""
"The bank's plan would target norms and institutions that may still require generational shifts. It has taken Rwanda more than two decades to establish itself as a model for land reforms that boost economic empowerment for women.""No one benefits if women are held back,"" Rwanda President Paul Kagame said, arguing for land reform in 2015. ""We have to change mindsets, not just the laws."""
The World Bank hopes to spread that message.
German farmers and train drivers are scaring Germany's bosses
"In Germany, where workers and bosses run many companies jointly, a big strike is unusual. A wave of big strikes is almost unheard of. Right now the country of ""co-determination"" is simultaneously facing an eight-day ""action week"" by irate farmers, who blocked roads with tractors, a three-day strike of railway workers and, to top it off, a looming strike of doctors, who already closed surgeries between Christmas and New Year's Day. This Mistgabelmop (pitchfork mob), as some have taken to calling it, will test Germany's harmonious labour relations in the year to come."
"The protests were ostensibly set off by the government's decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. These measures pushed farmers over the edge. It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government's self-imposed austerity. On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay."
"In an effort to defuse the tension with the farmers, the government agreed to a gradual removal of the diesel subsidy over three years and to keeping the exemption from the car tax. The farmers pooh-poohed the concessions as insufficient. On January 4th an aggressive group of them prevented Robert Habeck, the economy minister, from disembarking from a ferry on his return from a family holiday. If the train drivers are similarly unimpressed, that could prove expensive for German business, reckons IW Köln, a think-tank. The rail strike could cost businesses €100m ($110m) a day if it forced them to interrupt production. The car, chemical and steel industries, Germany's biggest, are especially reliant on rail transport."
"The workers"" mood is increasingly angry. ""Appeals are circulating with fantasies of revolution,"" warned Mr Habeck. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is doing its best to fan the grievances. In Dresden the Free Saxons, another far-right group, infiltrated the farmers"" protest calling for the ""extinction of the traffic light"" (as the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, Free Democrats and Greens is referred to because of their party colours)."
"Thomas Puls of IW Köln fears that the strikes will harm the image of Germany as a place for business. Local bosses are already fretting about a German version of the gilets jaunes protests in France in 2018, which culminated in yellow-jacketed demonstrators torching cars on the Champs-Elysées and the police stepping in with tear gas. Jochen Kopelke, head of Germany's police union, warned in an interview with Tagesspiegel, a daily, that the farmers were probably ""just the start of an enormous wave of protest this year."" Germany was the only big economy to shrink in 2023, and the year ended on an especially sour note, with an unexpected drop in business confidence in December. This year is shaping up to be even tougher."
"Brewers froth over winemakers"" exemption from anti-waste rules"
"As the EU debates rules to limit packaging waste, beer producers argue they are being unfairly discriminated against with exemptions for winemakers from reuse targets and deposit-return schemes, but one of Europe's wine industry association chiefs says brewers should ""mind their own business."""
"European brewers have warned that exempting wine and not beer from deposit return schemes and reuse targets is unfair and potentially illegal, as lawmakers enter final talks over a new law designed to turn a surging tide of packaging waste across the EU."
"Environment ministers agreed an EU Council negotiating mandate on the proposed Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) before Christmas, paving the way for imminent political talks with the European Parliament, which are already underway at the technical level."
"""Our position is clear,"" the trade association Brewers of Europe wrote to MEPs and government negotiators (10 January). ""If targets and mandatory requirements in the PPWR apply to beer then there is a legal obligation that they apply to all alcoholic beverage categories."""
"The 18 December ministerial summit yielded a carve out for winemakers from the requirement that, by the end of the decade, 10% of products must be supplied in reusable containers within a system for reuse or refill, rising to 40% in 2040. The exemption would also apply to the requirement, likewise supported by the European Parliament, that wine should be exempt from deposit-return schemes that should be put in place by 2029 under the proposal."
"Both the Czech and Belgian ministers immediately expressed reservations at the 18 December summit about the unequal treatment for brewers, but acquiesced. Belgium, which now chairs the rotating EU Council presidency and is therefore in principle neutral in terms of inter-governmental negotiations, hopes to clinch a deal with the parliament by early March."
"Ignacio Sánchez Recarte, secretary general of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins trade association representing some 7,000 wine producers across Europe, is dismissive of the concerns of the beer makers. He told Euronews that a market dominated by multinational brewing conglomerates bears no comparison with one comprised almost entirely of small, domestic producers."
"More than 99% of the domestic wine sector is made up of micro- to medium-sized companies, Sánchez Recarte said, questioning the solidity of legal arguments made by brewers and asserting that his organisation had focused on presenting policy makers with information ""relevant and appropriate"" to its own industry."
"""It is not my role to estimate if the beer sector should have this or that target, as it would depend on the intrinsic characteristics of their own sector,"" Sánchez Recarte said. ""In the same way, brewers should mind their own business and focus on their own responsibilities."""
"Brewers of Europe shared with Euronews a brief legal analysis it sent to the European Commission last year, where it argues that wine and beer are competing products that are ""at least partially, substitutable with each other,"" and which argued that rules favouring one over the other would distort the market."
"Simon Spillane, the lobby group's head of operations, said brewers were ""already leading the way"" in packaging sustainability, citing the example of beer kegs being reused around 165 times before being crushed and recycled after 30 years. They support reuse recycling systems already in place in many countries, he said."
"""We therefore advocate for an ambitious PPWR but need a level playing field in packaging legislation where beer and other alcoholic beverages play by the same rules, with each sector contributing fairly to reaching the targets and supporting collection systems,"" Spillane told. ""Any other approach puts the brewers at a competitive disadvantage."""
The Biden Administration Is Letting Corporate Criminals Off the Hook
"Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA enforcement attorney and the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, praised the Biden administration's recent improvements on enforcement while acknowledging the strong headwinds such efforts face. ""It takes years of sustained funding and political support to build a good enforcement program,"" he told me. ""The instability in Congress is not only demoralizing to EPA staff but undermines their ability to think strategically over the long term."""
"The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD. Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average."
"The Department of Justice's overall approach to corporate crimes has come under intense scrutiny from advocates. While watchdogs have lauded some steps the department has taken during Merrick Garland's tenure as attorney general - like finally establishing a database on corporate crime - Biden's DOJ has also leaned heavily on leniency agreements that allow companies to defer or avoid prosecution, and encouraged companies to scapegoat individual employees so as to avoid a broader charge. Kenneth Polite Jr., former assistant attorney general for DOJ's Criminal Division, revised the division's corporate enforcement policy so as to limit prosecutions."
Government Shutdown Debate Fuels House Republican Civil War
Conservative spending hawks in the House of Representatives bucked party leadership today - derailing a series of votes - in protest of Speaker Mike Johnson's recent spending deal with Democratic leadership that they feel does not go far enough in fiscal reductions.
"While the Louisiana Republican can avoid confronting the issue for now, on January 19 the country will face its deadline to pass four of 12 annual spending bills. Johnson has publicly stated that he would not support a ""continuing resolution"" (CR) to extend the deadline on these four bills to the February 2 due date for the remaining eight."
"However, with that deadline just 9 days away, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said Congress will need to pass a CR to keep things open, meaning the speaker may soon break a promise he made, largely to appease his right flank. Such a maneuver could ignite a heated ideological battle in a closely divided House over the GOP's role in spending cuts that may see the government face a partial shutdown or Johnson removed from his job."
"""I've been very clear that CRs are not the way to fund our government that the Budget Act of 1974 calls for us to pass the 12 appropriation bills,"" Congressman Matt Rosendale of Montana told Newsweek. ""We've had ample time to do that, and if the leadership does not direct the committees to get the work done and the members to be able to vote upon it, that therein lies the breakdown."""
"House Speaker Mike Johnson is pictured in the U.S. Capitol on December 12, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Johnson faces an unruly Republican conference that cannot reach an agreement on government spending levels. Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images"
"Rosendale, a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, was one of the individuals who derailed the Wednesday votes. He views the top line number in Johnson's deal as being too high and as doing too little to cut the $34 trillion national debt."
"Rosendale was also among the 71 Republicans who opposed the Fiscal Responsibility Act struck between Democrats and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a deal that set the parameters for Johnson's recent negotiation with Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer."
"Johnson celebrated his deal for cutting an estimated $16 billion in spending, but the Freedom Caucus believes he could have gotten more. Moderate Republicans who backed McCarthy's deal see that stance as unrealistic and running counter to the Republican goal of forcing Congress to pass the 12 individual spending bills as opposed to the ""omnibus"" measure of recent years, which combined those 12 bills into one vote."
"""New year, same idiotic behavior by some,"" New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler told Newsweek. ""We're not doing an omnibus, so each bill is going to have to be dealt with at conference and negotiated. Obviously, the reality is we're probably gonna need more time to do that. And I don't support a government shutdown, so I have no problem with doing a short-term CR that allows for this process to be completed."""
"Congress has not passed all 12 bills individually since 1996. Lawler said it's worth delaying passage of four of the bills to ensure the process is done right. If Congress cannot pass the 12 bills by December, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a 1 percent budget cut would be applied to defense and non-defense discretionary spending."
"Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky, one of the Republican Party's most vocal budget hawks but not among those who protested the Wednesday vote, said a yearlong CR that triggers the 1 percent spending cut may be the most feasible way to keep the government open while ending ongoing ""brinkmanship."""
"However, he said the most ""responsible way"" to cut spending would be to pass all 12 bills. With many Republicans reticent to see a shutdown and a 1 percent cut to defense spending, the urgency to pass the bills could see enough Republicans ally with Democrats to extend the deadline on the four spending bills and reach an agreement to fund the government, even if doing so puts Johnson in hot water with some of those on the hard right."
"""That [1 percent cut] is supposed to be motivation and leverage to get 12 separate bills done,"" Massie told Newsweek. ""So, I think we could do a one-year CR, we can argue, and then we hit that tiny little bump in the road, then hopefully everybody's motivated to come to their senses. That's the way I would do it."""
Regulators Approve New Bitcoin ETFs in Watershed Moment for Crypto
"The Securities and Exchange Commission begrudgingly approved exchange-traded funds that directly hold bitcoin Wednesday, a move long-awaited by fans of digital currencies and criticized by financial watchdogs skeptical of the crypto industry."
"The commission authorized 10 exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that invest in bitcoin, including funds proposed by giants such as Blackrock and Fidelity as well as by smaller financial companies."
"""While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."""
Gensler also added that the approval of the bitcoin funds did not imply the SEC would approve funds or exchange-traded products (ETPs) based on other digital currencies or assets.
"""Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws,"" Gensler said."
"The SEC rejected applications for similar funds for years. Last year, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled against the SEC's refusal to approve an application from Grayscale to convert a derivative fund into one that would directly bitcoin, calling the SEC's position """
"""Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares,"" Gensler explained."
"The much-anticipated approval has been hailed as a watershed event for digital currencies that proponents say will broaden access to investing in bitcoin and possibly lead to broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets. The price of bitcoin has exploded higher in recent months, rising from around $25,000 in September to more than $45,000, in part because many bitcoin investors believe the ETFs will create more demand for the asset."
Critics blasted the SEC on Wednesday night.
"Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-founder, President, and CEO of Better Markets, said the approval is a ""an historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability."""
"""With the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans,"" Kelleher said."
Complaints of Russian language use in Ukraine rise 30% - RT Russia & Former Soviet Union
Authorities are urging the population to file reports in a bid to de-Russify the country
The number of complaints to authorities in Ukraine of a person speaking in Russian increased by 30% last year. Kiev actively encourages the population to report such cases in a bid to allegedly 'protect' the country from Russian influence.
"According to the office of the commissioner for the protection of the state language, 3,692 language law violations were reported in 2023. Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa remain ""leaders in terms of the number of complaints of violations. Therefore, strict controls over the observance of the language rights of citizens in all spheres of public life should be among the priorities of community leaders this year,"" Taras Kremen, the country's Language Ombudsman said."
"Kremen also confirmed that a 3,400 hryvnia ($89) fine had been imposed on a Kiev taxi driver who serviced his clients in Russian. The ombudsman reminded the public of a ""detailed algorithm of actions in case of violation of the right to receive information or services in the state language,"" urging people to immediately file complaints on the commissioner's website when such cases occur."
"In 2019, Ukraine adopted a law that makes using the Ukrainian language obligatory in all spheres of public life, including government, medicine, science, education, and the media. Failure to comply can result in fines. Since 2022, when the military conflict with Russia began, Ukraine has undertaken a campaign of total de-Russification, with MPs saying it is necessary in order to defend against Russian influence. Local authorities have introduced complete bans on Russian-language works of art, performances, books, films, songs, and its study in schools and universities, and recommended that schoolchildren communicate in Ukrainian even during breaks."
"Last August, a teenage signer was briefly detained and forced to record a video apology following a performance of Soviet singer Viktor Tsoy's songs on the street in the city of Lviv. The dismissal of several teachers who spoke Russian to their students also resulted in a public outcry."
"The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Alexey Danilov, has previously said ""the Russian language must disappear"" from the territory of Ukraine ""as an element of hostile propaganda and brainwashing of the population."""
"Moscow maintains that such laws violate the rights of Russian-speaking people, who make up around half of Ukraine's population. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in February that Kiev's ""discriminatory campaign"" against the language was growing more and more ""indignant."" In a survey conducted last September by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, respondents cited language discrimination as the most common type of prejudice in Ukraine, with 45% saying it was a problem."
"Don't let SNP to turn health service crisis into the ""new normal"" - Scotsman comment"
"As the latest tranche of NHS figures reveals more bad news, we should be outraged"
"An 83-hour wait in a hospital A&E; four-in-ten patients waiting longer than four hours; 30 ambulances queuing outside a hospital, unable to respond to other emergency calls; staff ""leaving shifts in tears"" over the standard of care and ""a near collapse of performance,"" according to an expert at the Royal College of Emergency Medicine."
"If anyone dares to say that Scotland's NHS is not in a state of crisis or that these are just the usual winter problems, we should be outraged. The danger is that politicians like the embattled Health Secretary, Michael Matheson, will succeed in their efforts to convince us that, while regrettable, this is somehow acceptable, that there is nothing more that ministers can do in the circumstances, that this is the new normal."
"Amid calls for his resignation over the abject failure of the SNP's NHS recovery plan, Matheson spoke of how the ""heightened winter pressure"" was ""not unique to Scotland."" Instead of ""blame Westminster,"" the attempted defence this time was ""Westminster's just as bad,"" as if that provided any comfort to the legions of patients forced to wait for hours on end in pain and distress."
"He admitted that the age-old problem of delayed discharge - in which patients well enough to leave hospital cannot do so, often because the necessary social care is not available - was a ""major factor,"" but claimed an action plan was being ""implemented at pace."" Given this has been a persistent issue for years, few will have high hopes the SNP has finally found a solution."
"Indeed, new Public Health Scotland figures show the situation is actually getting worse: 1,910 people were delayed in hospital in November, up from 1,730 in April. One reason why ambulances cannot drop off patients promptly is that A&E departments are full because wards are full."
"Judging by the state of our hospitals, the SNP's talk of recovery plans and action plans is simply that - talk, and dangerous talk at that. We must not allow incompetent politicians to lull us into complicity in the demise of that great British institution, the National Health Service."
Construction waste recycling firm opens new Cumbernauld plant amid circular economy drive
Move will also help transform land at the derelict Gartshore Works site.
A Scottish recycling business that has already processed more than a million tonnes of construction waste has opened a second plant following a multi-million pound investment.
"Brewster Brothers"" wash plants transform 100 per cent of the excavated soils and rubble they process from the construction industry into high-value aggregates for reuse. Over the past six years, the firm's site near Livingston, West Lothian has prevented almost 1.35 million tonnes of construction, demolition and excavation waste going to landfill. It has created more than one million tonnes of recycled aggregates to sell into the industry."
"As part of a £6 million-plus expansion of the business, Brewster has now opened its second recycling site, regenerating the old Gartshore Works near Cumbernauld. The new plant will serve construction sites, housing and utilities developments in the western part of the Central Belt. The plant near Livingston, which currently employs 39 people, will continue to provide sustainable waste management services and recycled aggregates to businesses in Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians."
"Scott Brewster, managing director, who set up the business in 2017 alongside his father, Alex, said: ""It's increasingly clear that the construction sector in Scotland appreciates the need to reduce the amount of natural resources that the industry uses and the amount of carbon it emits while increasing use of recycled and secondary materials. The volume of construction, demolition and excavation waste that's been recycled over the last six years has grown enormously, and our investment into this second site demonstrates that there's room for a further expansion in this area."
"""Scotland has big ambitions for transitioning to a circular economy, and the government plans to bring in a new devolved aggregates tax that should accelerate the shift away from the use of virgin products."""
"As part of the firm's redevelopment of the derelict Gartshore Works site it has recruited new members of staff supported by Scottish Enterprise's Green Jobs Fund. The firm will also recycle the old bing of colliery waste on the site, and the area will be turned into a country park for the local community."
Politicians get it wrong when it comes to rent caps
"There is always the temptation for politicians to intervene in situations where they think they can make a difference. Of course, if there was an obvious simple solution to a problem somebody with more knowledge and understanding of the problems would already have implemented it."
"Thus, we had the introduction of the Cost of Living (Tenant protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 nearly 18 months ago which sought to cap rents for a limited period to ease the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis. What we find now from the latest Scottish Government statistics is that, in the last year alone, average rents have increased in all sized properties, ranging from the lowest rise of 11.7 per cent for one-bedroom to the highest figure of 14.3 per cent for two-bedroom homes. Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three."
"There were plenty of warnings from all involved in the housing sector that this would happen, but these went unheeded. An unwillingness to believe that market forces are what dictates prices rather than government has led to enormous rent price rises which could have been avoided with greater understanding, negotiation and discussion with the sector and a plan that understood the principles of supply and demand."
"With the Cost of Living Act legislation ending on 31 March 2024, a new consultation document seeks to extend controls on the level of rent increases that can be levied in the coming year. The consultation ends this Monday and proposes rents be set by the lowest of three comparators: open market rent; a landlord's proposed new rent; and a ""reasonable"" increase devised from a new taper system using comparison with a percentage of market rent."
Scottish tenants are likely to face further alarming rent increases if experts are not heeded (Picture: Adobe)
"This tapering proposal would set rent increases between 6 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent which, ironically, would be higher than historic annual price rises. But, more importantly, this scheme would be unwieldy, overly complex and prohibitively expensive to monitor and implement. We already have a system involving the first-tier housing tribunal which rules on whether a rent increase is fair. This seems like adding further layers of bureaucracy with no gain for landlords or tenants."
"Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved. Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis. Anything else is simply not going to work."
Greggs plans to make more dough with major further branch expansion while holding prices
FTSE 250 firm famous for sausage rolls and steak bakes plans to rise branch network but not prices.
"High-street bakery chain Greggs has said that in the year ahead it does not plan to hike prices, and is aiming to open 160 branches as it targets locations outside city centres."
"Chief executive Roisin Currie told PA she has ""no plans currently"" to up prices at the till as it expects a more stable cost base over the year ahead. However, she added that it would be ""a long time before we see deflation"" that would allow the group to start reducing prices, with retailers among those facing higher wage bills due to increases in the national living wage - although she added that the trend of bigger pay packets is ""good news as it puts more money into consumers"" pockets."""
"Greggs has also revealed plans to debut up to another 160 stores in the year ahead, and cheered a strong end to 2023. The group opened a record 220 new shops over 2023, with 33 closures and 42 relocations, leaving it with 145 new sites on a net basis and taking its total estate to 2,473."
"The FTSE 250 firm is to open between 140 and 160 outlets on a net basis in 2024 as it looks to give customers more convenient access to its stores. It will keep looking at expanding across retail parks, travel sites, and roadside locations, plus industrial estates. Currie said: ""Where there's any location where you can't currently access a Greggs easily, we want to try and get into that location."""
"It also plans to continue rolling out evening opening hours on a targeted basis, with extended hours currently available in around 1,200 of its shops. The firm in a trading update posted a 9.4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales across its own-managed shops in the fourth quarter, a slowdown on the 14.2 per cent growth seen in the previous three months, as Greggs said there was less contribution from price inflation. It saw full-year comparable growth of 13.7 per cent, with total full-year sales up by a fifth to £1.8 billion."
"The business also said it continued to see strong demand for vegan options, having recently brought back the vegan steak bake, as well as Christmas ranges, including its festive bake, chocolate orange muffin, and Christmas lunch baguette."
"Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Greggs ""can tick off 2023 as a year of real progress"" on the back of extended opening hours, more delivery options, improving supply-chain capacity, and ""a fresh new suite of tasty treats."" He added: ""Festive bakes and chocolate orange muffins lead the way over Christmas, but bears may point to sales growth slowing over the year, and the fourth quarter was the lowest of 2023. That's largely because Greggs was able to limit price hikes as inflation cooled. Longer-term, that's a net positive."
"""One of Greggs' key strengths is offering a lower-value treat and keeping that proposition intact is key, especially when consumer incomes are stretched. The most important thing is to see volumes trend higher, and that remains the case. The job's not done. Expect to see more progress over 2024 as investment continues into the digital offering, delivery partnerships and expanding the store estate."""
Rishi Sunak's law to strike down wrongful convictions may have serious unintended consequences - Scotsman comment
"Politicians who think they can overturn judges"" decisions are effectively putting themselves above the law"
"As has been pointed out for years by, among others, The Scotsman, the wrongful conviction of hundreds of Post Office branch managers in the Horizon scandal is one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in history. People were sent to prison, lost homes, marriages and reputations, and endured the mental torment of an honest person treated as a criminal."
"While the root cause of their problems was the flawed Horizon computer system, Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake told MPs yesterday that the evidence showed ""not only incompetence but malevolence"" by the Post Office. He lamented that just 95 out of more than 900 convictions had been overturned. Now, a new law is to be introduced in England and Wales to exonerate the scandal's victims, with Downing Street saying it will work with the Scottish Government on similar steps."
"It is extraordinary what can be achieved by a poignant television drama - ITV's Mr Bates Vs The Post Office - in an election year. After years of inaction, politicians are suddenly falling over themselves to do something. However, there are problems with Rishi Sunak's approach."
"The first is that a blanket law clearing hundreds of people may inadvertently include some who were guilty but, given the pressing need to clear the innocent, this may be a price worth paying. The second is more serious. A law overturning court verdicts may set a dangerous precedent at a time when populists are testing the boundaries of political power."
"In the US, Donald Trump is attempting to claim that, as president, he had immunity from prosecution. In the UK, Boris Johnson illegally suspended parliament to facilitate his Brexit plans, while Sunak wants to overturn a Supreme Court decision that Rwanda is not a safe country by passing a law to say that it is."
"The concept of the separation of powers - the government, parliament and the judiciary - is a vital safeguard against tyranny. Politicians who think they can strike down judges"" decisions are effectively putting themselves above the law. Voters must make clear this is not a position they will tolerate in anything other than the most extreme circumstances."
Bring back oversight for WA's jails. Lives depend on it
"The Washington jail system is experiencing a fatality crisis. This is one of the uncomfortable but unavoidable truths we confronted as co-chairs of a legislative task force charged with studying our state's jail system and recommending changes to help make jails safer. Although we come from a variety of backgrounds, including jail administration, civil rights advocacy, and experience being incarcerated in jail, we all agree that there must be independent oversight of Washington's jails."
"More than 130,000 people were booked into a Washington jail in 2022, and yet there is startlingly little information about what occurs once they get there. Washington has no statewide office responsible for monitoring jails and reporting data to the public. Some of the only information available relates to deaths in custody."
"What we found demonstrates that immediate action is required. Even accounting for Washington's population growth, the Washington jail death rate nearly tripled between 2000 and 2019 - an increase 16 times that of the national average. Outpacing other states, Washington now has the fourth-highest rate of jail deaths in the nation. This cannot continue."
"Reversing the trend of jail deaths, and solving the many other issues facing our jails, may require some difficult policy decisions. However, independent oversight of jails is a critical first step toward a safer and more humane jail system. Independent oversight is a demonstrated means of improving transparency and accountability both in Washington and across the country. By our count, at least 25 states have a statewide office responsible for overseeing jails, and all of them have a lower rate of jail deaths than Washington."
"Closer to home, Washington has recently established or expanded independent oversight of state prisons, police, schools, and other entities. Jails are the notable exception to oversight of institutions that are responsible for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people."
"An independent jail oversight office can monitor conditions in jails, meet with staff and incarcerated people, report on conditions that they have witnessed firsthand, and even communicate concerns before people are hurt. A jail oversight office can also collect and report data, helping administrators, policymakers, and the public understand our jail system and advocate for data-driven solutions to jail deaths and other problems relating to jails."
"Oversight is not only for the benefit of incarcerated people. Our task force recognized that an oversight office can partner with overburdened jail systems to provide much-needed assistance and recommendations, including smart policies that promote staff safety and reduce recidivism."
"Washington state briefly had a statewide jail oversight office from 1981-87, which the United States Department of Justice once trumpeted as a model for systems around the country. Unfortunately, the Legislature eliminated statewide jail oversight over the objections of jail administrators, civil rights groups, and others."
"Independent oversight will promote public trust and data-driven decision-making in a field that has for too long operated without the benefit of transparency. We ask the Legislature to enact into law our task force's recommendation to restore independent oversight of our state's city, county, and regional jails. People's lives depend on it."

How to find out if you're flying on a Boeing 737 MAX
"For most travelers, the aircraft model isn't a deciding factor when booking a flight. But with the majority of Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets grounded around the country after an Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout on Jan. 6, some prospective passengers may want to know how to tell what type of plane they'll be on and which models are the safest. The first is easy enough to answer - the second is a little more complicated."
"The airplane model is typically noted in the booking information for a flight. On Google Flights, it's included in the flight details when a listing is expanded, and it's usually listed on individual airlines"" reservation pages. If, for some reason, the plane type isn't apparent on Google Flights or the reservation page, sites like Expert Flyer and Seat Guru aggregate flight information like seat maps and aircraft type."
"Determining which aircraft models are the safest is less straightforward. The National Transportation Safety Board maintains comprehensive databases of information about accidents and incidents. The Federal Aviation Administration also provides preliminary accident and incident reports, which include the manufacturer of the aircraft involved, from the past 10 days on its Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing page."
"Another useful resource the FAA links to is the Boeing Worldwide Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents 1959-2022, which assesses plane-type safety by breaking down accidents based on the aircraft model. According to the report, which was published in September 2023, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are the aircraft models with the fewest total hull losses, an accident in which the aircraft is destroyed beyond repair. There are a few additional models in the report that have never experienced a hull loss, including the double-decker behemoth Airbus A380. But those models had accumulated fewer than 1 million departures at the time of the report."
"The report also includes a comparison of hull loss accident rates per million departures, which helps account for the fact that some of the models are more common or have been around longer than others. The Airbus A310, which was introduced in 1983, has the highest rate of hull losses - 2.53 per 1 million departures - among the models that are still in service as passenger aircraft. The Airbus 320 family, which includes the A321 and A319neo, has the lowest rate, at 0.11. The Boeing 737 MAX line, which has been around since 2017, has a rate of 1.48."
"It's important to keep in mind that, even though these rates are per million departures, some of the plane models in this report - for example, the Boeing 727 introduced in 1964 - have been around for decades and consequently had much longer to accumulate an accident record than others."
"Perry Cooper, a media representative from the Port of Seattle, which oversees Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, said in an email that there are a wide variety of reasons accidents occur, ranging from equipment to human error. So while it's easy enough to determine what type of plane you'll be on, it's more complicated to determine what that means from a safety perspective."
"While you can make some comparisons of aircraft models based on the available data, the FAA advises against trying to compare airlines based on their accident records. According to a report cited by the administration, ""there currently is no evidence in accident data that would support the ranking of individual airlines based on their safety records."""
"While there are often significant differences between airlines"" safety records at any given point in time, this is largely due to the ""infrequent but catastrophic nature of an air accident,"" according to the FAA, and these apparent differences between airlines even out over time. The FAA declined a request for comment."
How Betta Edu became a scapegoat of a dysfunctional political system
"In a recent incident involving Betta Edu, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's administration, there have been calls for her removal from office amid allegations of misappropriation of a N585 million palliative fund. The minister has faced significant public backlash following the exposure of a leaked memo where she purportedly instructed Oluwatoyin Madein, the Accountant-General (AG) of the federation, to transfer N585 million to a private account."
"As per the leaked memo dated 20 December 2023, Edu directed the Accountant-General to transfer the funds from the account of the National Social Investment Office to the private account of Bridget Oniyelu, the accountant of a Federal Government poverty intervention project called ""Grants for Vulnerable Groups,"" a project under Mrs. Edu's ministry."
"Speaking on behalf of Edu, Rasheed Zubair, her media aide, asserts that the act is legal within the framework of the Nigerian civil service. However, it is crucial to note that the request violates various sections of Nigeria's Financial Regulations 2009, which explicitly prohibit fraud and other forms of corruption in government business. Additionally, Chapter Seven, Section 713 of Nigeria's Financial Regulations 2009 explicitly states, ""Personal money shall in no circumstances be paid into a government bank account, nor shall any public money be paid into a private account."" It further stipulates, ""Any officer who pays public money into a private account is deemed to have done so with fraudulent intention."""
"In an interview with Ventures Africa, an anonymous Senior Legal Official from a leading commercial bank commented, ""There are several issues concerning this matter. First, her ministry is relatively new, and her predecessor and pioneering minister, Sadiya Umar-Farouk, engaged in activities that appeared to be illegal. It might be a reflection of how they operate in the ministry. Nevertheless, paying public money into private accounts goes against public procurement rules."" He added that unless she can provide a valid reason for such approval, it may not necessarily involve fraudulent intent, but it is nonetheless incorrect, and certainty is lacking."
"In a Twitter post, political and digital communications expert Akin Akinwale expressed the opinion that the ministry might not have been wrong to use a personal account."
"Expressing a comparable sentiment on her Twitter account, Political Analyst and Development & Management Consultant, Barrister Iyabo Awokoya, conveyed sympathy for the suspended minister. She believed that the minister might have made an innocent mistake driven by a zealous determination to accomplish her job."
"Based on these expert arguments, it can be inferred that there exists a discord in financial laws between the federal government and other government parastatals. The situation escalated when the leaked document became public, with Betta Edu emerging as a scapegoat for a dysfunctional political system."
"celeste is my favorite ""tiny good freeware game to big bloated commercial game with stupidly detailed art"" corruption arc because in the original getting the double dash is a contextless powerup in a treasure chest and in the commercial game it Makes Me Cry"
"In general I really like the interplay between the two games. The advantage of shortform stories is that you can ""skip to the good part"", they can be more immediately engrossing and satisfying. The advantage of longform stories is that you can imbue whatever happens with way more emotional weight, you lose the immediacy in exchange for stronger payoffs."
"The climax of Celeste the commercial game is literally just the pico-8 game, blown up, with several hours of mechanical and narrative buildup letting it pop off way way harder. Celeste is so proud of its tiny parent game it throws in references like the memorial, the ""2000 M... 2500 M..."" progression, the power-up, the flag at the top. It lets you play the original game right from the title screen!"
"Celeste isn't ""the good version"" or ""the finished version"" of the pico-8 game, it's just a different approach to the same core story. As someone that loves both shortform and longform stuff, seeing the connection laid bare this way is really interesting and delightful."
"There's another mid-scale version that could've existed between the two that tells the same expanded resonant story but with a tighter runtime and less insane production values. I think that would've been my favorite incarnation as like, an emotional arc... as is, the main single player arc of the commercial game is ultimately a small piece of it, it's most interested in being a big playground for the world's most loved-on platformer physics. which is still neat, I think."

"@user9 I wonder if it has to do with SLAs. If a company is contracted to provide 5 9s or something, can they weasel out of downtime if they claim that it's not yet verified (internally). Like, updating their static status page would be an admission of guilt? Maybe I'm just being paranoid/cynical."
@user10 makes sense to me
"I’ve only ever had one surgery where I needed general anesthesia. It was a “minor” neurosurgery giving my brain more room from a condition I was born with that became symptomatic after having kids (chiari malformation). The moment I woke up has stuck with me, so I relive it a bit when I watch medical shows particularly with a neurosurgeon 😂. Hospital playlist has been on my list for a long time, and I’m really enjoying it right now. #kdrama"
"My surgeon is really thoughtful. He called the day before because snow was forecast, and as the medical team was fussing over me as I was coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room my surgeon noticed I was opening my eyes and the bandage was in my eyes. I mean plus doing the surgery. But still so disorienting. One of the most scary things I’ve done and I was asleep and it felt like no time."
"I was on my period but I was supposed to strip down. So they let me have these mesh underwear you wear after childbirth. But they strip you completely down in the OR and drape you. So at some point a nice nurse replaced my period care before I woke up. Aside from childbirth where I was conscious and getting help or as a baby, I’ve never had such a private care task done for me. That was also my one stay in the ICU. ICU stay was a precaution for my type of surgery."
"My surgery involved lots of rest so I watched seasons 1-3 of Grey’s Anatomy. It helped McDreamy was a neurosurgeon. I would pay attention to how the patient was positioned just in the event I could guess what happened to me. Since my surgery in 2018, Hospital Playlist has shown more dramatization of neurosurgery than any other medical show I’ve seen since Grey’s. It is nice to have art and entertainment to help us make sense of our life."
@user32 I could perform a liver transplant thanks to Hospital Playlist.
@user33 wow!
i think a lot about how millennials were the last generation to be able to grow connections with artists without the pressure to impose a critical eye.
"we came up during a golden age of media, with a collective consciousness around pop culture that no longer exists."
"we got to jump right into things without having to consider the source, because it wasn't as easy to determine."
"with no reason to question the pedestal we put them on, those parasocial relationships became prominent building blocks that shaped our lives."
this is why we have such strong ties to nostalgia.
"when The Office was still on the air, my friends and i would order pizza and get together to watch it every thursday."
"it was unlike anything we have now with streaming, where 12 episodes are dropped at once and everyone watches at their own pace, prefacing social media posts with “spoiler alerts” or keeping discussion in specified silos."
we subconsciously crave tapping into the universal community that used to surround it all.
"it’s why so many of us are still obsessively watching shows like The Office, or movies like Anchorman that provided endless one-line references in a meme-like fashion."
we parroted these references back and forth to one another with the assumption that most people would get it.
"these days, even when something goes viral on a massive scale, we can’t assume everyone has seen it."
there is too much to focus on and no way to streamline it … will we ever escape the oversaturation?
we get trapped in cycles of discovering new media only to find out the artist is a predator or bigot.
we are forced to grapple with holding onto nostalgia while acknowledging that the people who created the art we connected with can be extremely flawed.
we step into parasocial relationships more gingerly.
we understand that it is hard to get to these positions of wealth and power without stepping on others along the way.
"in the absence of collective consciousness around media, we developed a level of class consciousness that helps us stay critical."
some of us are still putting people on pedestals only to act shocked when they fall.
we are in a period of flux and i am anxious to discover where we might settle.
@user11 Inclusion and safety should be the default.
@user12 @user11 inclusion and safety are always a good thing to prioritize. what default you are referring to?
"@user11 with the loss of shared experience due to an over saturation of content and the ever increasing polarization of our world, it’s so easy for bad actors to just ruin any chance of us getting together and enjoying things. Sorry, should have clarified haha"

Very niche issue but it kinda sucks these days that if you're interested in building/customising lil robot figures you HAVE to build something made for war and killing things
"like back in the 00s you had bionicles, which were essentially adventurers/heroes with elemental powers and actual distinct personalities and hobbies and stuff, but like before and since then its just been stuff like Warhammer, Gundam, Battletech, where everythings geared to being a weapon, showcased to gratuitous effect in accompanying media"
"and sure, these other sources are AWARE that ""war is bad"", but then you're still selling the killing machines as figures and merch. So, like, what are we doing?"
"I imagine the answer is to just kinda divorce the design from its fictional intent, ppl do that with real world tanks and jets after all, but my brain is having a DIFFICULT time w that"
"Bc the figures do look cool, and I like they way they're constructed, and how the design reflects certain characteristics, but then every set is like ""oh by the way here's your laser sword and (at minimum one) gun!"""

"Balance in academia is rare, but time away from the page is when the best thoughts occur. 💭"
Pushing harder to publish more doesn’t always yield better results. It’s important to focus on recovery when striving to be a better scientist.
Here are a few ways that I am recharged:
Use both sides of the brain. 🧠
"As scientists, we use analytical side of our brain most often. But when using both the creative (i.e., guitar, painting, etc.) and analytical sides of my brain, it feels as though I increased my mental capacity — making me better in both spaces."
"Training muscles, not just the mind. 💪"
"Exercise is not just for those looking to be triathlon athletes or for looking better. It also benefits quality of life—thoughts, moods, productivity—it is all connected. Taking breaks from the desk make time at your desk more productive."
Permission to relax. 📺
Sometimes recharging is not about adding more habits—enjoying a good movie or a fiction book is just as beneficial as creating and physical training. The key is feeling ourselves that it is ok to relax and not do anything. There’s no room for guilt here!
"These are tactics that I found help me feel recharged, but there are many others. What do you do to stay excited for science and avoid burnout? 🤔"

Maybe a fisheye lens is a bit overkill for a nesting box.
You live and learn.
"I probably should've known better since I already built one with a ""normal"" lens."
I'll be posting more about this during the weekend when I get to install the second one I've built.
Let's just say the birds will have a better Internet connection than me in 2015.
Or at least that is the plan.
The box that has already a nest in it is leeching off the wifi in the house.
The other one will need some more work to get online.
"Ok, so during the day I hung up the new nesting box. This is what It looks like in its net place in the garden."
"But let's rewind a bit. ""What's actually in there?"" I hear nobody ask."
In the top is one of those ESP32 camera boards with a fisheye-lens camera and an IR-LED I stole off a Raspberry Pi camera.
The reason for the weird shape of that plastic box is the swiveling side panel of the nesting box. I bought it like that and couldn't modify it so I had to design around it.
"Since there is no electricity in the garden, the whole thing is powered by a solar panel and a 2600mAh 18650 cell."
"I didn't photograph the cell or the charger, but here's a picture of the panel."
The gray box that hangs on the side of the nesting box is where the battery lives.
"On a full charge, it gives me a runtime of about 4 hours."
I call this a feature. That way the birds get some privacy too.
"Initially, I wasn't sure if the internet in our garden would be good enough for this setup. The old access points I replaced last year in the fall wouldn't have cut it."
But the new ones cover that area just fine.
That is almost a bummer because I was planning on mounting a TP-Link cpe210 on the roof and having it point downwards to the garden.
"I still might do that when/if I set up more camera nesting boxes. Especially in areas further from the house, I might need it."
"Now, for reasons I'm not sure about yet, the camera is offline. It went out only one hour after sunset."
Maybe it stopped charging the battery 3 hours before sunset due to insufficient light.
Maybe it couldn't fully charge up in a little less than half a day.
I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow.
I don't have any telemetry for the battery. This is something I might add in a future revision.
A few more sensors in general would be nice I guess.
And maybe a battery that's at least on paper capable of running the thing over night.
"Oh, and a different lens."
Fisheye is way overkill.
"But I'm already browsing Digikey for parts, so I might just build myself a custom PCB for this exact use case."
Or not. We'll see.
Aaaand it's still offline.
Great.
According to the proper solar panels on the house the sun is only really up for about 90 minutes.
Let's give it another hour or two to see what it does(n't).
Still offline.
Nothing ever is easy.
Turns out the USB-C breakout I was using to plug into the Battery Charger had 5V and GND swapped on the silkscreen.
Swapped over the leads and now I've got a charging light.
"The ESP didn't go online immediately, let's give it a few minutes."
One hour later and it's still offline.
Looks like it's reboot-looping and triggering Tasmotas reset feature.
"I guess the panel just sucks ass. I now ordered a bigger one, hoping this does the trick."
Look what I found in my Workshop.
It's a 24V Panel. Sadly the sun is so low (and partly obstructed by a tree) that it drops down to basically nothing as soon I put a load on it.
So I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrow to figure out if it actually is enough for this setup or If I need the better panel I ordered.
"According to Amazon, I bought the panel in 2021 and It should output 12V at a max of 1.2A."
"So either there's something wrong with this panel or my multimeter, or they changed the listing."
Good news everyone!
They changed the listing and the one I have is borked.
Both the old and the new Listing titles call it a 12V 10W panel.
This is why I don't delete old emails.
"Hey, look: the thing went back online for like half a minute about one hour ago."
Maybe the panel trickle-charged the battery just enough for 38 seconds of runtime. It only took a bit over two hours to do that.
Guess what: It's cloudy today. So I'm not sure if that (probably broken) solar panel is able to generate enough juice to achieve anything.
Let's wait and see.
Update: I installed the new panel and now it seems to work.
"It still might die as soon as the sun goes down, but let's wait and see."
Funfact: I'm using the ping integration in Home Assistant to monitor if it's online or not.
The average round-trip time is 102 ms. Not great not horrible.
I got new stickers.
"No theyre not for sale, I normally hand them out when at events etc."
BUT I was about to place some around Finsbury Park for you to find if you wanted one but it’s too windy and they wouldn’t stay put.
Finding an alternative shortly…
Free Matt Gray stickers.
They’re hiding in big Sainsbury’s at Haringey Green Lanes.
If you get there first don’t grab them all leave some for others.
"Don’t travel too far, someone will beat you to it."
If they’re not claimed today I suspect the staff will find them.
A couple of extra other stickers I had on me too
Let me know if you find them!
If you don't happen to be by that random supermarket:
If I'm at an event I have them on me. The only upcoming events in my calendar currently are:
@user49
Superbooth Berlin (just an attendee)
"If you happen to spot me out and about, feel free to say hi!"
I sometimes have stickers on me.
(Though do mention you recognise me off the internet otherwise I'll be wondering who you are and where I know you from)
I'm not selling them because it's not economical.
These good quality stickers are about 50p each. They'll cost the same again to post. And way more in my own time to individually package and send them.
"And I know demand is relatively low, I had a barely-used merch site for several years :D"
Another one has been found!
@user50 Found in the mirror universe?
Absolute rocket from from Stroud on a perfect half turn to goal. #DCU #MLS #MastodonFC
Really tough not to buy that the league tells officials to help Miami when that’s not a penalty. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc
"Probably Pirani's best game this season, but he still just needs to be better. Like the aggressive call to sub him out for an offensive minded player like Fletcher. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc"
Amazing how there's two PKs #DCU should have had and got neither. The fix is so in for Miami #MLS #mastodonfc
"Well, perhaps ball doesn't lie. What an awful give away by Klich. Can't win when your DP plays that sloppy. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc"
"Absolute meltdown. Obviously, the officiating hamstrung them, but the last twenty minutes are the play of the team that did not deserve to win. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc"
"Very curious to see how this #DCU team responds to a game that's best forgotten. They've had a bright start and sometimes bad games just happen, but they looked completely outclasses as the game went on. #MLS #mastodonfc"
"@user7 who give a crap, go Badgers Women’s hockey! Hahaha"

Last free weekend for a while.
Next week Saturday: Picocon @ London
Easter weekend: Eastercon 2024 at Telford.
After that a couple of site visits on Saturdays with a client in Swansea.
"I better get some motorbikes fixed, or else!"
Damn this rusty K1100! Is there a single screw which has not seized?!
"Finally the battery is out. Managed to wiggle it out w/o removing the last screw needed, but that screw will need dealing with. Tomorrow morning's task."
"Almost there. New one is in place, just need some black isolation tape to be sure."
Got some somewhere but exactly where?
Heheh not one but three!
Success! Last thing remaining is bolting the seat back.
"Getting my eyes checked, because there was a decent deal for it here, and my left eye’s been weird for some time now, so maybe they can tell me something what’s happening."
"I’m splurging on a new set of frames, these red ones I reeeeally like."
"So, apparently the ghost image my left eye sees isn’t too much of a concern. But I need basically varifocals too. So the lenses have a combo of those. Not the full on varifocals but something in between those and ”normal” glasses (no idea of the terminology in English)."
"While this was being told to me, I made a decision to get another pair, and that pair are these."
"@user36 I like both the glasses you posted, these are a really nice colour...makes me want new ones 😂"
"@user37 My current collection consists of two green pairs, one blue-purple and one pinkish lilac pair. The last one’s at home currently, but I usually carry at least two pairs with me."
I’ve been tempted to get sunglasses with prescriptions but they don’t make these for that purpose 😆 I bought the golden aviators on a whim one birthday.
"@user36 that second pair is really nice! I love buying glasses...I never throw them out but somehow I can't find any of the others?! Mine are rainbow coloured at the moment, I need some sunglasses too... but if you need prescription they're so ugly 😂"
"Running a business as a self-employed introverted creative and having a big heart for privacy shouldn't feel like a twist, but sometimes it is. The majority of online resources and coaches tell you to work with big (and evil) tech using extrovert techniques. Advertise here, follow the algorithm, share your personality. Get a blue tick on that service, be available 24/7, answer inquiries with a video of yourself, respond immediately. Video, video, video."
1/3
It's a year of transition for me.
"I don't want to feed Big Tech with money, data and my energy. Or coaches who have their one extroverted solution that they apply to everyone. I'm exploring new ways of doing business, while fighting my long-held belief that you have to do things a certain way to be successful."
Wish me luck!
First steps are already done.
"I quit FB, removed all Meta and Pinterest tracker from my website and killed my private WhatsApp account."
"I also removed the last external tracker, Google Analytics, from my website yesterday and it feels good."
I recently subscribed to an European based CRM for better GDPR support and am moving my business over in the next weeks.
"I transferred my MX to Proton and have now full SPF, DKIM and DMARC without having to pay Google for basic email validation."

@user3 @user2
"I'm so to read all this - well done, you!"
"I am about to be in a similar situation. I will need a new website and am making a list of the accessibility and privacy requirements I want (so no Google Analytics, etc.) & investigating how to make using Signal standard for video call; it will mean a lot of client education! - but worth it, I think."
@user4 @user3 You can do it! And I would be happy to share my insights with you.
"Website: take a look at @user5. It seems to be easy, looks great and is opensource. Will switch one of my sites before the next renewal."
"Signal: Check out cal.com. It's an opensource calendar service with integrations scheduling of video calls with Element call, JITSI, etc. They support Signal as well, but I haven't tested if it's text or video."

"A person is here to fix my kitchen floor, so I'm gonna pretend I still have a job and am wfh while editing Too Hot to Handle."
If I can get the file to fucking open. (Fuck One Drive.)
*hacker voice* I'm in.
And this is when he starts drilling Super Loud. Yay.
"It feels uncomfortably passive aggressive turning up my air purifier to max, but I can smell the wood dust, so it would be justified even if he weren't an anti-masker. And I do actually need to protect myself??"
"I really want to go back to bed, but I can't until he's gone."
"On the plus side, chapter 4 is finally edited!"
"Chapter five is a long one, but so fucking angsty. Yisssss, the good shit."
Doing find and replace on ... ➡️ ellipsis symbol and there are 54 in this chapter 😅
"But no, I stand by it. Most natural speech is broken up, especially when people get emotional."
"Floor repair person is doing a vacuum, so hopefully that means he's finishing up."
He went outside to (from the sound of things) cut something up. So I sneaked a peak on progress. Still a long way to go :(
7 pages left in chapter five. Still my fave chapter and it's in pretty good shape - mostly typesetting changes and very minor edits for active voice and conciseness. But I could really do with a break and a cuppa and the dude is still doing things to my kitchen.
He just started vacuuming again. I hope it's a good sign.
Kitchen-floor fixer is gone!
"He told me he did a quote for the whole floor, but the landpeople cheaped out and only paid for the bit by the door where the integrity is gone. It feels a lot better."
Not the house is ventilating and my air purifier is running in the kitchen while I enjoy a cuppa in the garden!
The best part of Hugging Face’s “The Stack” is that ~the majority of~ many of the repos it lists for me are — and always have been — private repos.
Well it looks like I have a GDPR complaint to file
Actually now that I’m double-checking several of these repos were deleted… years ago even
Like…
"Either there was a window in time where I had set these public, or something else is happening. Not all of my private repos are in there."
@user40 https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@user41/112130028394563476
@user42 this is very interesting because it says my latest public post to my-blog was in 2022 but I am certain this repo has been private for several years
Just encountered a facial recognition system while boarding an intl flight from Houston's IAH. Apparently it's for some customs-related thing??
"They said it's not mandatory so I had them pause it and ""manually board"" me"
I should add that they said it's not mandatory only once I went up and explicitly asked •_•
@user18 what does it check your face against?
@user19 I can only assume that it's my visa or passport pic. I should've paid closer attention.
"It's my first ever crown dentist visit: Prep today, then fitting in a fortnight. I'm practising opening my mouth wide."
"Well, that was a lot of filing."
Stumpy and I are home and feeling better now we’ve had a couple of mugs of tea. Back in a fortnight to get the job finished.
Or not.
"Dentist wasn’t happy with the fit of the crown, even after he’d footered and filed it. So new impressions were taken, and a new crown will be made."
Stumpy gets a stay of coronation.
"And we’re on again. I’ve got a cancellation for tomorrow, so it’s take two on Stumpy’s crowning."
Stumpy has been crowned. All hail King Stumpy.
@user34 I can almost hear the fanfare.
@user35 Honestly didn’t want to get my hopes up after the last time.
Now I just have to get used to this strangely smooth tooth so I can stop poking it with my tongue.
"@user34 I find that irresistible after dental work, takes days for the tongue poking to stop."
Yea so I flew this today.
"first complaint: we need cute logbooks. black is boring, pink is not even pink, it's salmon."
I've wanted to fly since I was a child.
And it happened today... I flew a plane today. I'm still actually processing that.
data from flightaware.
Going to try and get out there again this coming Saturday. Weather doesn't look good right now but it's only Monday.
So the challenges in this are already showing themselves. I'm likely going to have a VERY difficult time getting a medical clearance due to the FAA's stance on certain medications.
"Not impossible, but it's going to take a VERY long time and require a LOT of extra work."
"While disheartening, it's just yet another problem to solve, and it *does* so far seem solvable. Just at great expense of time and $$."
In case you're interested in the challenge ahead I face.
FAA isn't a fan of ADHD. Definitely won't let you get a medical cert if taking medication for it.

"If I ever have the opportunity to have a custom tail number for an aircraft, you KNOW it has to be some variation of N1337_, the _ being whatever final alphabetical char is available."
"Of course the sun is gonna be out while I'm away, lol. What a punk."
I need to be in the air again. And the weather is not behaving.
Welcome to General Aviation 😜
"I'm getting the vibe that aviation tend to track farily conservative based on some of the ads youtube has decided I should see, videos I'm being recommended, and comments I see."
"If the weather behaves, I'll be flying again on Saturday."
"Also, I found a pink logbook."
Happy Saturday morning. I did this today ^_^
#TeaganAir
Its log book official. I have 2.3 hours ^_^
#TeaganAir
"If u asked me to describe what flying a small plane is like, I'd say it's a combination of a motorcycle/ATV and a boat at 4000 ft in the air"
On the ground things get very fast very quickly. There's a certain Mount of instability on the ground hence motorcycle/atv.
"Also if you didn't know, you steer a plane on the ground with your feet, not the control yoke. Rudder pedals and brakes. It's not a car."
"In the air it's bumpy and floaty and feels like you're in a boat on the water. You have control, but sometimes a wave knocks you around a little bit, so u need to get your sea legs except in the air."
Oh another random tidbit:
Flying is physical. Today I'm *sore* in my back and legs like I went to the gym.
This isn't like hopping in the car for a Sunday drive stuff. It's closer to a sport than a cruise in my newly initiated opinion.
Happy Saturday lovelies. Welcome to 4000ft.
Going back up tomorrow and we're doing stalls and slow flight.
"Choppy day today, but super fun. We did slow flight and stalls. At one point we had our ground speed down to 16mph with an airspeed of 65."
"It was a nice clear day, a little hazy at altitude, but nice none the less."
FlightAware data track.

"This stuff really is like going to the gym. I ended up taking a 2 hour nap today (just waking up) because I'm physically tired. I'm also rly sore, especially my legs. LOTS of right rudder today."

"I’m using tailwind for a project, very begrudgingly"
seems like learning css would be easier tbh
this is just a bit shit
i should stop tooting about this tbh but this tailwind component library pointing out how bad the default tailwind setup is is hilarious to me
you know what has semantic class names? css and class names
don't even need a library for it or anything
the jokes write themselves
"“get simple, semantic classes simply by using these two libraries and a build tool”"
“brb just updating the padding on paragraphs boss”

I was pushing for 100k meters this month and I ought to get there.
Now I wonder if a million meters in 2024 might be possible? 🤔 #peloton

Apparently there are only two levels that haven't been cleared in the original Super Mario Maker lol
"Edit: is now down to 1. Just ""Trimming The Herbs"" left and omg I genuinely don't know if anyone will ever beat it legitimately. It is a ridiculous level."
"Final edit: that level turned out to be a tool assisted upload, which no one thought was possible at the time but apparently it was! But people still persisted and it got beat in the end! https://fgc.network/objects/0f1b42c6-cbb1-49bb-91f5-db81bc71ea14"
"Been watching some clear attempts and like.. as a person who has played a lot of reasonably hard Mario stuff, everything else aside, grinding Trimming the Herbs (the last level left) looks soul crushing."
"And it turns out that level was uploaded with a TAS after all, so it is no longer considered to count and they've declared victory. Kinda anticlimactic tbh but GG to the people who got everything to that point!"

And just under the wire basically someone actually beat Trimming the Herbs! Really impressive.
@user1 I can't believe the level that was so hard and took so long to complete is only 17 seconds long!
alright let's goooo!

"tomatoes are all sprouting. I was nervous they would get leggy so bought a $50 set of long grow lights, but I hink I'm doing that Terry Prachet boots thing where I should have just sprung for a real grow light instead of cheap alternatives"
love to see it!
finished putting up rabbit fence. It's sunk 6 inches underground I very much expect it to keep rabbits out
moving the best tomato seedlings to bigger containers
I hotboxed half my lettuce and arugula to death with a plastic tray cover but other than that seedlings are doing pretty good!
going to plant some stuff today
"there we go - radish, mustard, lettuce, spinach, and bok choi"
reconditioning all the container soil I used last year and starting my cucurbits. It's half spent potting soil from a friend's weed operation and half topsoil from my folks beds
Time to start smashing up our bedroom. Last room in the house that’s had nothing but quick bit of decorating done to it.
"Remove horrible electric fire and hearth. Box in chimney, replace blown plaster and skim. Build custom wardrobe."
We always start with a rough pencil sketch…
Got the messy stage out of the way.
Found a few dead bird at the back of the flue; very desiccated :(
Ready for the plasterer next week
Pleased with the little side niche
Insert new wardrobe here (not that we have even started on designing this yet 🙈)
"Ooo, look what we found behind the radiator!"
And even remembered to add the cute little air vent to keep the chimney from getting damp
Sweep has done the capping and cowling. Should be a bit safer for the rooks that like to nest up there 🪺
Plasterer has finished. We’ll lay the floor tomorrow!
"Cork underlay is down, fashioned a toilet-roll sawdust extractor accessory for the hoover 😂"
Some floor sorted & ready to go down. We’re just having a tea break
Boo. Slow progress today due to super awkward cuts around the door jambs to get a seamless transition into the hallway (which is also getting laid). @user45@twitter.com has been cursing me
"Finished, but broken! The icing on the cake was the terrible assembly instructions for the new bed. We are gonna sleep well tonight!"
"Still to do; hallway floor, all the skirtings. Decorator is coming in a month, so it’s bare plaster chic for us for now"
Quick bit of evening DIY to tenon saw/chisel out the bottom sections of the door jambs where we want the flooring to fit neatly underneath.
Hallway cork underlay is down too
"We finished the hallway floor yesterday! Then 5am start to collect Thing 1 from Heathrow this morning, then a nap, and final straight for hallway; skirtings on. Will caulk when glue cures"
"Imagine a very long web page with lots of sections (e.g., single-page HTML spec). If the user requests a specific section (e.g. page.html#section7), what if the web server streamed that section first and the other sections after that?"
Stream order:
1. start of HTML document up to <body>
2. HTML for section 7
"3. HTML for section 1, 2, 3, etc."
The browser would then make sure to insert the sections 1 to 6 *above* section 7 on the web page.
Does this make sense? Would this be useful?
What I want to achieve is have the linked section (#section7) render as fast as possible without having to re-implement stuff with JavaScript. I just want to have a super long HTML document but still have linked sections render as fast as possible. It should just work with HTML.
"The content could be streamed like this, and then the browser would inject each <contents> into its <div>."
<div id=sec1></div>
<div id=sec2></div>
etc.
<div id=sec7>section 7…</div>
<contents for=sec1>section 1…</contents>
<contents for=sec2>section 2…</contents>
etc.
"It would be streamed out of order, but the browser would assemble the HTML document as if it were streamed in order."
"@user22 You can reorder documents like that without JS even. You can’t use hash part of the URL if you want the server to do something though, but you can use query string search params to let the server know which section you want first. You’ve got a choice for reordering the parts:"
1. Use CSS
2. Use template with slots
"@user23 Yes. The problem is that the visual order (what the user sees) does not match the DOM order. It may be useful if there existed an HTML feature that would allow streaming out of order, but the browser would then arrange the content in the DOM in order."
But the slots approach looks promising. I’ll give it a try.
"@user22 oh, you want the browser to fix up the DOM order?"
"@user23 Yes, that’s the idea. The section 7 would be streamed first for the sole reason that the user can view it as soon as possible. If that can be made possible without affecting the DOM order, that would be good, so the browser would make sure that the resulting DOM order matches the visual order."
"In other words, stream section 7 first but make the end result (DOM and visual) be as if all sections streamed in order."

"Welcome to CSA in Italy. CSA is believed to be an ancient Roman settlement. The site was excavated at least four times over the last century. What is there to excavate if Koa is originally a Roman site? Was the Pantheon in Rome excavated? No, the pantheon is even at the same ground level as the surrounding, contemporary buildings. And why is that? Because the pantheon was probably built during the Roman era, it is also almost cardinally oriented, which indicates that it cannot be very ancient."

"Now I need to quickly mention the reactor's name, as it was considered a zero power installation. You see, a zero power nuclear reactor is capable of sustaining a stable fission chain reaction, with no significant increase or decline in the reaction rate.

"This is an authentic and real old footage, of a true certain giant individual from Japan, walking in some military parade. What's shocking about it, is his actual size.

"I encourage them to challenge their teachers even when they think the teacher is wrong about something.

So that kind of famously as a Congressman explained to all of your votes on Facebook, which is a rare concession by authority to say, okay, this is why I did what I did. Yeah, and actually, you know, a lot of the people in leadership and in Congress didn't like that I was doing that because I was giving people at home the power to challenge them."
"The question is, like countless other claimed Neolithic ruins, how did they achieve such feats? How did they lift such enormous stones? Were they, like we have posited many times before, the remnants of a once advanced yet destroyed ancient civilization, we find such possibilities, in particular, the men here of Agra, highly compelling."
"So I bought an Xbox Series X so that you don't have to. Or maybe you actually have to. In this video, I'm going to tell you all the pros and cons of choosing an Xbox Series X. I'm also going to go over the actual hardware, the controller, the games just about everything that is my experience so far with the Xbox Series X. So I hope you will enjoy this video, and maybe even find it useful."
"I'm sure marine dinosaurs still exist. My apologies for intruding upon your thoughts, Madame Roseau. But strictly speaking, only reptiles that walked on dry land are called dinosaurs. If they lived under the water, they are called marine reptiles, and they all disappeared a very. Very long time ago. What happened? You'll see, Julie."
"So once all that is done, I wipe away all the excess powder with a little bit of alcohol and a paper towel. Super easy to clean, and then I apply my cuticle oil. This is actually face oil from T, but I didn't like how it was so stinky. I didn't want to put it on my face, so I use it as a cuticle oil. And this is the final product of my nails. I love them and I'm obsessed. A couple of frequently asked questions. How long does my nails last. I usually leave my nails on for two weeks. Sometimes I take them off early because y'all know I do my own hair, and I gotta have my libs when I do my hair, because it's easy to grip."

"Where I'm standing would have been the bottom of the Western Interior Sea, about 85 million years ago. Mike Everhard is one of the world's leading experts on Mosesaus. The horizon would have been ocean for as far as you could see, that the seaway stretched for hundreds of miles from where we're standing. At this time, the climate is warmer, so there are no polar ice caps."
"All right, well, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it down to a small riot, would you? Danny, when are we going to be able to afford a larger car? When you're about 10 years older and can marry a millionaire. I had more room than my baby bug. Yeah, I haven't finished paying for that either. In fact, I still owe two more payments to the hospital before I own you."
"Today we're going to talk about Ben Affleck defending an interview. Greg, why don't you to tell us about the video we're going to watch. Yeah, so a couple of weeks ago, Ben Affleck went on a two hour interview with Howard Stern. He talked about his breakup with his ex- wife and family, and he had some fallout from it, so here we go.

"And now you see that whatever happens backstage, it doesn't matter because the show will go on. And I got a comment from Lovely Lich that you really like the video. And she writes, I like the behind the scenes things, like traveling to the fish, the atmosphere there, the food and stuff a day in your life, so to speak. So I hope you liked this video and we'll show you as much as possible. So now it's time for lunch, and Deep is making some scrambled eggs. And the trick here is to add an extra egg yolk to it."
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Disagree. If the enemy of your enemy were your friend, he'd explicitly be your friend. You know, oftentimes people can work together for a time, united by their dislike for something or someone. But if that relationship was conceived by your mutual dislike for whatever that thing is, what's to stop that relationship from dissolving or becoming hostile after that thing is taken care of. Like the foundation of a friendship is much more stable than that. But you know, I also understand the short term strategy behind it, so I'll just disagree."
"A long time ago, their parents were killed by poachers and Cheyenne and Kuyu were sold at the market. Taken in by the Help Congo organization, they grew up in semi- captivity with about 30 other orphans out on the islands. One after another, these young chimpanzees have been shown the way back to the forest. The association scientists have given them each a name to identify them."
"And because of that, you cannot trust any media outlet to report on the news fairly or accurately. Now that being said, I still think there's some value to the mainstream media. Just because they are exaggerated and biased, doesn't mean they can't be trusted at all. There's still a lot of useful information you can gather from these sources. You just have to know how to analyze them properly. The same is not necessarily true for the alternative media, the smaller companies or even individuals who talk about the news on sites like YouTube and Facebook."
"And when you download it, it should be a pretty quick, small file size. You're going to get an app that looks just like this. So I could click on that right now. And this is the view that you're going to see right away here. And so I'll talk about a few things with the lab. Now one thing to note is that the lab instructions for the lab worksheet that you're going to work on are pretty self explanatory. So really, the purpose of this video is to show you how to use the app itself."
"Well, it still sounds better than Pink Floyd, so in Manic Miner, you collect all the items on the screen and head to the goal. And you gotta do it before you run out of air or hit something. Hit what exactly? Weeds! You can die from touching grass. It sounds like half my fanbase. And did you notice I died from touching a weed that was on a completely different platform? I just went through the platform and then hit the weed. That's good game design, man. And then there's this asshole over here who's gone."
"Alexa play, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to. Whoa, whoa, we gotta spit that out. Alexa play, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to. You cry too if it happened to you. Woo! Alexa, Midnight!!!"

We have a news section now that looks at the issues and opportunities surrounding data security and network security and healthcare."
"Hello, it's Bayano with Bayano Reno. We're going to prepare some grout. The tars looks to be about 14, 15 years old. We're going to do it just to stabilize the tales because the way it is, the tars looks good. It's just losing up in some area. We don't want to play the whole tile grout. We're just going to do some repair to last until we are ready to do a full renovation. Yes is this a recording?"
"So my dad can't give me rides to work. And for me, work is about 27 miles away. So there and back would be nearly a hundred dollars a day with Uber. I haven't looked at Lyft. I could have, I guess, that makes sense. But I didn't have rental on my auto insurance, so that's my fault. So I guess I could have tried to do that and get that set up and tried to get a rental while I was down and out of a car. But even then, a rental would cover seven days. I'm going to sneeze, hold on. That sneeze sucked."
"Now talking about stars, Howard Jones appears as a special guest vocalist in a duet with you on the album. On the track, I Made a Case, who has offered you so much encouragement with your music.

We've all got a chance. The world's full of beautiful things. Not for us, swampers. Yes sir, for all of us."
"Hey Psychtogoers, and welcome back to our channel. Thank you so much for all the love you've given us. Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now let's continue. We've all done something self- destructive at some point in our lives. Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual. So here are seven common behaviors of a destructive person."

"How did you very early on, considered or realized that, well, engineering, is just part of the challenge, especially that we're taught as engineers that we're dealing with issues, right? And we're finding solutions. That's our job. How did you came across that so early on? Well, it was a strange coincidence, so to speak. Of course, I grew up in the 1970s. I gained my political consciousness, as well as my academic understanding in the 1970s and that context matters, of course, massively."

Number one, re-refining used oil. Don't just discard your old oil. With the right processes, oil can be fully re-refined and reused indefinitely without any reduction in quality."

"Nearby Basil was awoken by an emergency alert as a Faustmanning gas cloud from the blaze was spread across the area. Locals were told not to leave their homes and to close all windows and doors, although this alert was lifted around 7 AM when the smoke was thought to be non fatal. It wouldn't be the air so much as the water that would be heavily polluted, and it would be the very water used to douse the flames that would caused the disaster. The highly toxic mercury compounds were present as fungicides in sea dressings in the warehouse, and were marked with fluorescent red dye Rhodamine B."

"This is aluminum, aluminum for our industries and aluminum for our homes, aluminum for building, for transportation, for communication, for agriculture, and for national defense. What is it that has made aluminum, one of the youngest members in the family of metals, such an outstanding material? The answer lies in its amazing versatility and unusual combination of properties. Its smart, modern appearance in a variety of natural or colored finishes. Its great strength, combined with extreme lightweight, and outstanding advantage in almost every metal application."

I didn't say that. You don't have to. You know better than anyone that violence begets violence every time. The council made the decision. The council is gone. We spend our entire lives. Entire millennia devoted to protecting life.

"For a man, I feel more sorry for him than her, somehow. There's nothing can be done about it. The Dors had another sinking spell. The hospital doesn't think she'll last the day. It must be unbearable. I've never lost anyone. You get over it. Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Leslie. Oh, that's all right, Ms. Roe. You get over it. Eventually."

"Okay I died. There was some light there when I was panning. Yeah, that's what made me miss the shot. My ping is fine. Anyways yeah you can see what I mean by the frame rate. That's what I really don't like about this device. It can't keep up with the game, basically. So when I was shooting him, basically I was shooting at all the wrong places, not because of my ping, but it's because of the graphics lagging, basically. All right, so let's head over to COD Mobile."

How did that affect you? That was pretty cool, because by that, I learned greatness was the willingness to die."

"I know that a lot of you have been having some fun with my advancing years. You've even tied my recent surgery to my age. Well, I got to be honest with you. I had that same operation when I was young, and it felt so good. I wanted to have it done again before I was to. But I am aware of my age. When I go in for a physical, now they no longer ask me how old I am. They just carbon date me."

"With his general purpose military markings, the Guinean pufferfish doesn't mind being seen. The Atlantic lizardfish doesn't bother with disguises at all. It simply shimmies into the sand. This may fool both its prey and its predators. But it won't fool the pufferfish patrol."
"I like to wear gloves just because stainless edges are usually pretty sharp, like a razor, so you don't want to cut yourself up while you're trying to straighten it. I like to use the table as a dolly a lot of the time. They do also offer specialty trim or jeweler's hammers is what they're sometimes called. Also trim angles. But in this case, since it's a large flat piece, I'm just going to go ahead and use my standalone auto body hammer."

Lalabella remained the capital of Ethiopia from the late 12th to the 13th century."
"On Mars, which is a planet half the size of the Earth, there was a lot of water on Mars a long time ago. To do that, there's a volcano on Mars, 81,000 feet tall, almost three times taller than Everest. So what's happened over the great span of time is more than really my imagination can grasp. So knowing how first water, first life, 3.7 billion years, we'll just say life. So, you know, pretty, pretty early in the early evolution of the earth."
"Sasebo Festival is a biannual, cultural, political, and artistic event forum conference that brings together quite a lot of different formats. We've been doing this now as a European alternative, the organization behind this for 10 years. So we have quite a bit of experience at the same time, it's an event that is nomadic, so it always takes place in a different city. The last time, two years ago, we were in Belgrade in a city outside of the European Union. This year, in 2017, we wanted to come to Madrid for quite a lot of different reasons."

"And I have a lot of experience. I've worked internationally. I've worked this continent. I've worked at different states, different market segments. And what I found is people are really intrigued by that. They want to know kind of what the behind the scenes is. So some of these videos are going to be tips from somebody that actually works in this industry and I think that's what separates me a little bit from possibly other travel bloggers that you might follow. You know, I may not have worked for, say, even in the cruise industry, but I had to take courses in it for my hospitality degree. So even if I haven't worked in it, I've been educated on it."
"You're a jerk. Look, Celia, we have to follow our passions. You have your robotics and I just want to be awesome in space. Why don't you just tell me that you're freaked out by my robot hand?

"Okay, so this final repair is spine repair. Spine repair, it's a little bit more complicated. There are more steps to it, but if you follow along with me, I think you can easily do it. So what I'm going to do first for the spine repair is I need to remove this old spine. So hopefully I can save this label and I can reattach it to the new material that we put over the spine. That way I don't have to worry about creating a paper label or going without a label. So I'll cut this part off first and I'll show you how to clean that up later."
"Welcome. Welcome, everyone. I'm just going to make sure that all of this is working. It just takes a minute. So I came on a bit early just to make sure, just washed my hands and getting ready to go.

"About 450 million years ago, plants took a giant leap out of the oceans onto the land to become the plants that we know and love today. But how did they survive? Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reached deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?"
"It seems that as we suspected, the evidence is mounting to support the far more logical claim that an advanced lost civilization's heritage has been stolen by different, more modern civilization all over the world. A great civilization did once flourish here on earth, one which has been actively suppressed, stolen from, exploited, and hidden for far too long. Thanks for watching guys, and until next time, take care."
"I'll never be a superhero. You have the power. The problem is you have so much that you can control it. I know who can help us train better. Of course! We'll start with virtual training.

"Hello and welcome to this travel vlog. Today we are exploring the city of Rotterdam. Rotterdam is a city located in the province of South Holland. It is a city that divides opinions because of its more modern and urban- looking architecture. Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed during World War II when the Germans attacked the city. Because of this, the city had to be rebuilt, resulting it to look quite different from the other cities in the Netherlands."
"Affordable furniture DIYs are always a hit here on Lone Fox, so I wanted to share with you guys how I created this nightstand from a simple crate from IKEA. So this is the Nagle crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just e 6,000 these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to. And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand."
"What's up guys? Zach here with Better in Construction. For a lot of you, this is your first time on the roofing side of YouTube. So I want to welcome you guys personally by making a video that's very important to me. The subject of this video is, if I was to do this roof, and I've never shingled before, how would I do it? Knowing everything that I know now. So this is a video that's going to help DIYers or new shinglers not make mistakes and take the proper precautions to get this job done right without wasting time. So first things first, we need to familiarize ourselves with this material."
"While the rescue force patrols the city, we'll take care of watching over the museum in the box. It wouldn't be a good idea for the villains to try and steal the cabbonita with us waiting inside. We've run out of money! We'll have to steal that diamond and sell it! Otherwise, we'll have to do our experiments with solar pap. How are we going to get the bots inside? It's all taken care of."

"Hook the vacuum up to it, it helps keep the dust down and you can prep your concrete that way also. We prefer to do it with the hand grinders ourselves, so either way will work pretty good. Usually if it's got an epoxy coating already, the hand grinders work a little better, but this thing looks really good too. So after we do that, we fix all the cracks, fix all the divots with our patch repair material and then we grind them smooth, and then we clean the concrete and get it ready for the first coating. This is going to be a 100 % solids epoxy so it goes on and it's different procedures, different stages."
"The Zoroastrian text, Veda, states that Yema built an underground city on the orders of the god Arua Mazda, to protect his people from a catastrophic winner. Much like the account of Noah in the Bible, Yima was instructed to collect pairs of the best animals and people as well as the best seeds in order to reseed the earth after the winter cataclysm. This was before the last Ice Age, 110,000 years ago."
"Okay, so let me explain. All right, so the problem is, if you look inside there, you see the wood siding, there's the old siding, and it buzz up to the shingles there. And then I put this over it. And what happens is the dirt collects there to that flashing."
"Hey guys, Thunder E here and welcome to the video you've been waiting for. I am talking about gaming on the SUS ROG Phone 5.

"It is December 1997, and the Imperial Sugar Company is acquiring a new production site at Port Wentworth, from Savannah Foods and Industries Incorporated. There is nothing really of note here, it was doing what businesses do, and that is acquiring to expand. The site has been home to food production and processing since the early 1900s. Savannah Industries Incorporated, began construction of granulated sugar production facilities at Port Wentworth during the 1910s, completing it in 1917."
"The next 85 South Show. He needs no introduction. Where my man is done. We're gonna give him an introduction anyway. He's not an Atlanta, by way of Mississippi. You might have seen him on MTV walling out. Lady, he is the coldest in the game right now. Your baby daddy, Carlos Millers in the building."
"We're just going to let that sit and rehydrate for a couple of minutes. With ultralight cooking, we're not actually cooking on this dough. We're primarily boiling water so that we can rehydrate our food. It's also one of the reasons why we use instant grits. less cooking time, less fuel and less weight. Oh yeah. So this is about what we've got going on here. Perfect consistency."
"The thick cloud cover prevented sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth. The Earth underwent a global glaciation event, known as the Snowball Earth. This caused another global mass extinction. But once again, some life survived yet another difficult period, beneath the ice sheet."

It's the most potent energy source ever known, and now it's on display at the City Museum for all to admire. And we're going to steal it? Isn't it dangerous to slip through here? Negative. This is the way the kazoos are coming."
"With digital tools, it is easier than ever to create, edit, and publish your work to the world. But there's a cost. It's also easier than ever to spread misinformation, and fake news has become a real issue in recent times. We see this with students. According to a Stanford study, only 25 % of high school students were able to identify an accurate news story compared to a fake one. Students also had a hard time distinguishing between real and fake photographs as well as authentic and staged videos."
"Thirty million years ago, a monster roamed the landscape. While we're talking about one of the most ferocious animals that probably ever walked the earth. This was the biggest beast to live in North America since the dinosaurs. Look at the size of that skull. Look at all those teeth in there. There is no animal like this anywhere."

"Hello and welcome to a pilot of sorts of a new series. It will delve into the history of some of the world's worst scandals, some of you may know, and some you may not. It's been inspired in part by an RTE program called Scanal. Although, rather than focusing on events linked to Ireland, I plan to widen the scope of what I'll cover. Well, without further delay, let's get started."
"Yeah, I did some, I did some research to get ready for tonight, because like I said, I'm a real, the only thing I know about government is the reason we're here, which is that it doesn't work for us. Like that's literally all I know. That was kind of nice to get into. But I did some research of how a bill becomes a law. So I watched the Schoolhouse Rock video. Yes, we all love it."
"You, you the world! You're full of surprises, aren't you? I remember a few years back, watching some of those Resident Evil movies with Mila Jovovich and thinking, I can't get any worse than this.

"We are at Tukka Beach today. Tukka Beach is a resort here in Sierra Leone. I'm here with my cousins. Should be a lovely day. It's a really chill time on the beach. Nothing too much is happening or nothing planned, but, oh, it looks like they might be a wedding reception. Everybody's being married. It seems like there's a wedding or some kind of engagement. It looks beautiful out here. Look at this."

You saw technology at that phase, and you're also a surfer, so you know all about dodging the waves. What's the disruption that we most need to pay attention to, that's coming from the new technologies and why? Why should we pay so much attention to the disruption?"
"To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire ornament there. And then of course, we have to get that antique look with the alcohol ink. So I went in with ginger first, I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antique in like an actual metal ornament. After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well to supply that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments. And that is how I finished off these antique brass bubbles. Really simple and easy, but honestly, they look like real metal and they're beautiful."
GOOD RIDDANCE
"The advancement of Humanity never ceased, even for a moment–during difficult times we grow and adapt once again. The cities are as prosperous as ever, and our technological advancement is rising. With our recent discovery of Ignniat, humanity has once skyrocketed past its peak; the greatest has yet to be achieved. This grace of newfound knowledge could only be described as divine intervention - we humanity will be able to grace the gods with our presence in their land in the clouds. Everyone within the company of Karascene has evaluated Ignniat and we sense a large potential within this mineral – worry not, Ignniat has not been evaluated to have any side effects or downsides of being mined, it has a higher chance to–"
"JANUARY 14th, 10:26 PM, 2543."
"A click. It had been reruns of this same stream, the day the world was ruined. Dad always found himself turning the channel off when I was unable to tear my eyes away. The somber face he gave me ensured a gut-wrenching feeling transpiring from deep within – I always feel bad when it plays, but it opens the floodgates to so many memories; granted they weren't very good ones. Letting out a sigh, I slowly rose to my feet, gotta get my mind off things. His saddened mood remained, and regularly I’d try to help ease his mood and at least give him a little bit of joy, but today; I’m tired."
"I hold a relatively slow pace as I approach the door, giving a small holler to Dad. “I’ll be heading out for a bit, dinner is in the fridge.” No response. Figures. He usually hears me though, he’ll probably be fine. Slowly closing the door behind me, I let another breathy sigh escape as the door completely shut. Nearly forgetting, I place my hand on the cold, metallic scanner that locks the door. If there was anything this apartment had, it was advanced tech, but then again; most places had notable technology–it had been a long time since anyone had used any other different technology."
"The cold, rainy night ensued my long overdue walk–exploring the city of Paltricus was a privilege to those who’d been safe from the mutation via escape, or pure luck. The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years. It must be lonely in the great distant sky. Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living. Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat. The mineral that appeased technology, and architecture was a great mineral that extended our foundation of life. Public knowledge only knows so much about this mineral though, mainly because mainly because it’s kept under pretty tough wraps."
"Removing myself from clouded thoughts, I found my way to my favorite coffee spot; most people avoid it because rumors were spread that a lapse was found in the area, which was what society has referred to those whom the virus has infected. This never really disturbed me, I’ve had incredible luck my entire life, plus the owner is a great guy. Who would pass up free coffee in exchange for talks and chats late at night?"
"Walking inside, a loud ring dispelled my discomfort as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled my lungs. Anton, the man who owned the store, was of course the person behind the counter – the place was practically empty except for a few people in the back. Approaching the counter, my feet tired from a long walk, I droop atop one of the stools and yawn. I spot Anton bringing the regular thankfully. “Hey Lilith, Long night?” his raspy voice echoed within the fractals of my brain, “Something of the sort,” I replied shallowly, more tired and tired by the second."
"Ready to fix my fatigue, I took a few sips of the coffee placed in front of me. “Business still down since that sighting..?” I spoke quietly, not attempting to scare away the remaining customers that Anton’s unit had. He nodded, cleaning a glass with a rag – this place is technically a bar, but I never really came for drinks. A few murmurs could be heard from behind, but for the most part, the conversation between me and Anton was held rather short tonight. Waving him a small goodbye, I left the shop; with a little more energy than before."
"Wandering the dark streets late at night wasn’t usually the best option, but honestly, it was better than staying in that stuffy apartment; hell most of the time you could hear the neighbors having sex more than you could hear your music. With a quick, breathy sigh, I returned my gaze to the walk ahead–I’ll probably make my way towards Al’s Pawnshop; just a place I find junk that looks interesting, as a pastime. Quick regret flushed over me as I heard footsteps close behind, maybe I'm overthinking it, but nobody hung around this place unless they wanted to get mugged, or beaten up. It was popular for its mafia and gang activities…"
"Isn’t that funny? We have half the manpower left, and we can’t even refrain from hurting one another. I hastily sped up, Al’s was around the corner, so I would be fine inside. A glance behind me ensured that I was no longer being tailed as I stood in front of a bright glowing sign that read, “Alborn’s Pawnshop!” With slower steps, I entered once again–this place was more under the cover, as Alborn would often take in people who’d been mutated and snuck into Paltricus. Upon opening the door, the lights had been shut off, interestingly enough–there was no Al. No refugees. Nothing. Something wasn’t right here."
"Stealthily I made my way towards the back of the store, murmurs and talking heard beyond a metal grate which took a few yanks to tear off. Climbing into the vent was the safest and quietest option for me right now; climbing my way through, I’d pick up on conversations and talks between strangely dressed men. I noticed Al inside, chained. Figures he’d get caught eventually."
"Alborn was a great guy, but this looked serious. No need to stick my nose out for someone, especially when they seem like they’ve just gotten into trouble with every authority in the city. Yet, I still couldn’t shake the feeling. Letting a silent sigh escape me, I slowly warped off the grate below, dropping down into the quiet room. “Psst. Al. Al!” I whispered, giving a soft yell at his lack of response. “Lilith? What are you doing here..? You’ve gotta leave, he’ll catch you.”"
"No shit, I silently voiced to myself. Attempting to lockpick the chains that wrapped around his arms, voices closed in on our location, the faint footsteps growing ever louder. “Quick! Get back in the vent, and leave. Do not come back. If we meet again, it won’t be in this city.” He said hurriedly, the flash of panic on his face didn’t help my nerves at all. Listening to his advice. I couldn’t bring myself to stay longer. Fuck, Al. I quickly ran for it after exiting the vent; it hurt a bit to lose such an invaluable friend. Were they moving him to the…other city? So many things were flicking through my slightly scattered mind, and most of them were angry but sad. I’d done numerous kinds of research on the outer cities, and the capital of the infected, Alcatraz, which they named after the prison – felt like it fit the name pretty well from what I’d read. Not to mention the unmutated had cut any remaining connecting land with infected land, it was…tragic."
"The walk home was quiet, but so loud. The thoughts infecting my brain were booming, and the regret of not having stayed to help flashed over multiple times. I finally arrived home, almost brought to tears by the dreadful walk in the burst of sounds from the clouds above, the thunderous booms were enough to frighten any person sometimes. Dad was already passed out on the couch, some rerun of an older movie, probably 10-12 years old; sighing, I quietly crept my way back to my room. Flopping in the bed, I wasn’t able to keep my eyes open for long. Before long, slumber crept up on me."
DETONATION
"JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM, 2543."
"The days rolled past before I could even realize it. It was a few days since Alborn was taken away – to where I had no clue, but I knew he was taken somewhere. Those outfits seemed familiar, but no way was I going to figure it out on the first try. Sighing, I placed my hands on the system in front of me, emanating a red and purple glow – I could hack the security, the place isn’t far, and I doubt they took measures...Maybe I shouldn’t. Of course, against all morals, my fingers moved without my knowing, pulling up multiple screens; god I’m good. I was pretty popular on a couple of websites, they referred to me as “WRAITH.” Which was a pretty catchy name. Granted my name on any site is WR417H, but I like to think the public came up with it."
"Moving the surveillance onto my mobile device, I watched each one intently. Nothing. It was like they were never there. That makes no sense. Cameras had tight security, even with remote access. How..? ARGH. I stood angrily, ready to remove some thoughts from my head – I made my way over, sliding on shoes and taking my keys. “I’ll be back soon, Dad.”Silence. Whatever, he didn’t usually respond, he was probably busy doing something more important than me anyway."
"With a quick jolt, I felt a shiver enthrall its way down my spine as I made my way out of the apartment; weird. Ignoring the feeling, I urged myself to head towards Al’s to investigate a little, but my legs moved towards Anton’s small bar – it was a pretty calm place, and I definitely needed to talk to someone. Who better than a bartender who owes you something?"
"Irregularly, Anton’s was pretty busy; it was bustling with activity and new faces that I’ve never seen before – Anton was regularly the only worker, so knowing that he must be pretty stressed. “Hey Barkeep, get me a coffee.” I purposely spoke in a lower tone to throw him off a bit, a small chuckle escaping me seeing his sigh of relief after turning quickly. “God, Lilith, don’t do that to me…” he softly let out, obviously tired. “You seem pretty busy…you need some help? Look’s like there's more than plenty of folks here.” I huffed out, I do not want to help with these drunks, but I feel bad making this guy work alone out here. “Could you? I’ll pay you after…” he uttered with the eyes of a puppy, aimed straight at me. Advanced War Tactics…"
"After changing into the small uniform, I helped around the bar a bit, it was pretty easy aside from the constant flirting and cat-calling from the people within the bar; but it didn’t really bother me that much to be honest. I’ll talk to Anton after this shift, I still really need to get Al off my mind, though I know I’ll still investigate his place after this, but still…"
"A burst of flames erupted from Thassalin's jaws as the colossal Thraki set fire to a very specific patch of forest, then circled above, watching for moment. Weirdly, as he had slowed down, the weird screaming noise from behind him had stopped. Thassalin had forgotten he had passengers on his back."
"""Come on, Tenuk, you've shapeshifted into a Thraki before!"""
"""My own flight is very different from being abruptly dragged off by a massive, pink dragon!"""
"""It's not that bad, right, Kayel?"""
"Kayel clearly didn't agree with Nyssi, he looked less black than normal and his claws had dug into Thassalin's back to the point that he'd made the Thraki bleed, but Thassalin clearly didn't seem to care. That being said, Thassalin had realized he had scared his new friends and found a clearing to land in."
"""I APOLOGIZE BUT I PICKED UP A SCENT. I HAD TO DEAL WITH IT!"""
"""Did you have to drag us along as well?"" Tenuk snapped as he climbed off Thassalin's back, sliding down his tail. ""And we left Retvik behind! We abandoned our big, strong, fighty guy! How is he going to get to us?"""
"""He'll work it out..."" Nyssi tutted. ""Retvik's slow but he's not stupid."""
"""Yeah but can Retvik drive?"""
"Nyssi blinked and turned back to Tenuk. ""Of course he can drive."""
"""Have you ever seen Retvik drive a vehicle? He doesn't own a truck like you do, nor have I seen him drive something like that little cute car Kayel has, and he only started going to work by car because you keep on driving us TO work. He just has that bike of his."""
"A burst of laughter interrupted them. Thassalin was suddenly overly amused, but no one could work out what he was laughing about. It took a little too long for Thassalin to calm down."
"""I AM SORRY, BUT I PICTURED YOUR LARGE, ARMOURED FRIEND ON A TINY LITTLE BIKE MEANT FOR TEMTHAN CHILDREN. IT WAS HILARIOUS! I WISH I HAD SOME FORM OF TELEPATHY. IT IS A CHERISHED THOUGHT! ONE I CANNOT SHARE!"""
"Kayel snickered, as he could imagine what Thassalin was thinking about. ""Yeah, fair. But what did you pick up, and why did you fly off so quickly?"""
"Thassalin grunted, took off and disappeared briefly, before returning, dropping a carcass in front of Nyssi. It was an Orothrack, a very rare, gold and white draconic creature. But its head was missing. ""ANOTHER DEAD ONE. I HEAR THEIR CRIES. SMELL THEIR BLOOD. I AM DRAWN TO PROTECT AND HUNT. AS YISINI DEMANDS. THE CREATURES, THEY ARE CLOSE."""
"The mighty Thraki suddenly froze. Nyssi and Kayel also froze, their attention drawn to a gap in the clearing. Something large and black was staring at them, hissing. Whatever it was, it spread open two colossal pairs of wings and charged forward, aiming at Thassalin, not caring that it had to go through the three smaller beings. Kayel and Tenuk only just managed to get to cover, but Nyssi found herself dragged along and almost thrown at Thassalin."
"Thassalin responded to this attack by grabbing Nyssi and throwing her on his back with his insanely long, dextrous tail, before taking off into the air. The black, two-winged creature quickly chased after them."
"Kayel tutted as he drew his rifle from his back, then opened up a pouch, revealing a bandolier. He slung the bandolier over his chest for easy access, but quickly realized that Nyssi, the Thraki and the monster were no longer visible."
"""Hey, Tenuk, do you mind shapeshifting into something that can fly?"" Kayel asked."
"""You want to chase after them?"""
"""Yeah, duh."""
"""But... one of them is a giant monster!"""
"""So? I have a high-powered rifle in my hands, right now, ready to go. I just need to be able to, you know, see it, so I can shoot it."""
"Tenuk hesitated, then stepped back, giving himself some space. With a low, slightly pained grunt, Tenuk's body stretched out, his fur replaced with scales and his arms replaced with wings. He quickly turned himself into a normal, light blue Thraki, but his eyes remained red."
"""Climb on."""
"Being a more normal-looking Thraki, Tenuk now had proper plates of scales running down his back, but he'd also conveniently grown a pair of spikes on his back for Kayel to hold on to. It took a little too long for Tenuk to get airborne, but once he was in the air, he quickly orientated himself and tried to give chase."
"However, Tenuk and Kayel quickly realized they weren't alone. A second dark creature shot out from beneath them, and Tenuk only just managed to avoid a collision."
"""I guess that's the other big scary monster that Lanex was worried about?"" Kayel frowned as he attempted to take a shot at the second beast, missed and swiftly reloaded."
"Tenuk didn't respond, he was too busy concentrating on flying towards Nyssi and Thassalin, even though the other creature was chasing them. Kayel awkwardly turned himself around, so he could face the monster. The fact that it was giving chase was good news in Kayel's eyes, as it made it easier for him to aim and fire. Two shots passed through the creature's top wings, and it roared in pain, disappearing back below the trees. Whether it was still following them, Kayel wasn't sure, but it certainly wouldn't have been able to keep up."
"Up ahead, Nyssi was clinging on for dear life as Thassalin flailed around, blasting the blackened monster with bursts of flame. While the creature was definitely injured, it seemed very pissed off and unwilling to back off, and the fire balls didn't seem to be doing as much as they should. As Thassalin straightened himself out though, Nyssi took this as an opportunity to pull out her own weapon, a trusty shotgun. Sure, it wasn't meant for this sort of thing, but surely the scattershot would at least deter the black beast?"
"No, clearly not. The creature just hissed and tried to fly directly into Thassalin. Thankfully, despite his size, Thassalin was nimble enough to get out of the way, but Nyssi couldn't help but scream as she very nearly lost her grip on Thassalin's overly smooth scales."
"""HOW DO WE KILL THEM?"" Nyssi shouted."
"""AIM FOR THEIR HEADS!"""
"""THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY!"""
"Thassalin hissed, then circled round, closer to the mountain he called home. The dark beast followed, but somewhat panicked as a blast of fire hit it from behind. The creature hadn't realised it was no longer alone. It panicked further as Thassalin slowed down then thwacked his tail into the side of the beast's head, knocking it off course."
"Snarling and hissing, the creature flew upwards, spitting into the air. Everything suddenly went dark, as if the monster was sucking the light from the sky itself, replacing it with a cloud of perpetual night."
"No longer able to see, Thassalin tried to retreat, but found himself scraping against the top of the treeline, before crashing into a clearing. The creature seemed to know exactly where Thassalin had fallen and headed straight for him, taking the dark cloud with it."
"""Kayel!"" Tenuk exclaimed as he glided out of the cloud and began circling, trying to spot Nyssi and Thassalin in the darkness below. ""What do we do? Kayel..? Kayel, where are you?"""
"Below, Nyssi scrambled to her feet. She was pretty sure she had broken something, but her weird, unnatural healing powers had already kicked in. The same couldn't have been said for Thassalin, who was lying in a lump, resting against the one tree that hadn't collapsed under his weight. Nyssi did her best to try and reach Thassalin but she could barely see more than a couple of meters in front of her. Everything was pitch black and engulfed in unholy shadows. And in said shadows, something was screaming and screeching."
"A horrible, clubbed tail smashed into the ground near Nyssi, knocking her over. She noticed though that the tail was flailing, not aiming at her. The creature, what little Nyssi could see and hear of it, was snarling and clawing at the shadows it had created. Something was teleporting through the darkness, stabbing at the monster, confusing it."
"A gunshot suddenly filled the air, and the monster fell silent, collapsing on the ground and remaining still. The darkness all around them dissipated, revealing what had happened. Standing on top of the creature was Kayel, holding his rifle and breathing heavily."
"""That was... one of the weirder shadowjumps I've ever done... Thanto kat'olon..."" Kayel gasped for air. His eyes somehow were glowing black, and a dark energy drifted across his body. However, as he spoke, the colour returned to Kayel's organic plating and his eyes turned back to their normal yellow."
"It took a moment for Nyssi to work out what had happened. They were all aware that Kayel had weird shadow powers, ones that he rarely used because most considered them unholy and rather terrifying. But Nyssi didn't know that Kayel could use those powers in any sort of darkness. And, by the way Kayel was acting, he was pretty surprised as well."
"""You alright?"" Nyssi couldn't help but ask."
"""Yeah, I'm fine. I killed something, I'll be good in a minute."" Kayel examined his handiwork, as Tenuk made his way down and landed next to him, shapeshifting back into his normal Spast form."
"Now that the creature was no longer moving, they could better see what it was. Its skin was pitch black and slimy, but the slime remained firmly attached to the creature's body. It had four wings and four limbs, all of which were tipped with long, thin talons, and two straight horns stuck out from its skull."
"Before Tenuk and Kayel could ask what the fuck they were looking at, something screeched and leaped out from a nearby bush. However, it never made contact, as a familiar vehicle crashed into the side of it, causing the monster to skid to a halt by Nyssi's feet. Not taking any chances, Nyssi grabbed her shotgun and immediately fired into its skull, killing the creature instantly."
"""Oops..."" Retvik muttered from the driver's seat, before awkwardly switching the engine off and climbing out of the truck. ""I, uh, did not mean to do that. Are you all well?"""
"""You missed basically all the action!"" Tenuk tutted. ""Where were you?"""
"""You all did somewhat leave me behind. I got here as quickly as I could..."" Retvik sighed. ""May I ask, what are those horrible things?"""
"Retvik's question was thankfully answered by Thassalin, who had picked himself back up. He was covered in cuts and scratches and seemed a bit dazed, but he didn't seem too badly injured."
"""YOU KILLED THE CORRUPTIIDS! THE INFECTED MONSTERS. CREATURES LEFT HERE WHEN THE CORRUPTION ATTACKED YOUR GODS."""
"""You mean... the horrible god monster thing that we... helped kill?"" Tenuk stuttered."
"""YES. VERY MUCH SO. THERE MAY BE MORE. BUT I COULD NOT SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD. I LACK A GUN. ALSO TWO AGAINST ONE IS UNFAIR, YES?"" Thassalin made his way over to Kayel and patted him on the head. ""THANK YOU, LITTLE ONE. YOU REMIND ME OF MY OLD FRIEND ARKADIN. EXCEPT LESS MURDEROUS AND LESS CAPABLE OF KILLING UNIVERSES."""
"""Uh... thanks... I guess..."" Kayel shrugged. ""So, uh, are we done here?"""
"Nyssi shrugged, then grabbed her camera, taking some photos of the definitely now dead beasts. She then pulled out her favourite dagger, her fancy, death-god-y one, and started cutting off one of the creature's horns, before moving on to the other one. However, just as Nyssi finished, the creatures suddenly began to burn up, and quickly turned into a pile of ashes. The same thing happened to the horns Nyssi had cut off."
"""Well... that is both convenient and inconvenient..."" Nyssi sighed. ""I suppose at least I got pictures?"""
Prologue
"“Please!” Queen Eirwen begged, “don’t send her away! She’s just a child!” The Ice King looked down at his wife from his throne, his royal advisor next to him. She had given birth to a girl. He scowled at the thought."
"The girl in question looked a lot like her mother; pale blue eyes and white hair decorated with blue strands. The Ice King thought a daughter made him look weak. After all, he had only had sons up until this point."
"“The only options you have are to kill the child or send it out to the wilderness. This is her punishment for your wrongdoing, Eirwen .” He spat out her name as if it was poison. He always did."
"Frostfell was not always one kingdom. It was split in two, the North and the South. In the North, the non magical kingdom. To the South, a kingdom full of fantastical displays of power. Due to the North’s greed, the two kingdoms clashed in a never ending war, until the South offered a truce."
"The South was desperate, and their royal family would do anything to stop the bloodshed. They offered their only princess to be queen of the North and bear a son to be the future king. Then, the South would join with the North to make one kingdom. The North accepted, and Princess Eirwen married Prince Akull."
"“I beg you, my king, in return for the safety of my child, do whatever you want to me, lock me up, banish me, or even kill me.” Queen Eirwen pleaded, holding her child tightly in her arms."
"The Ice King looked down at his queen, disgust from his eyes. Maybe, just maybe, he would have mercy on her. The woman who he had been with for twenty-two years, the one who always cared for him at his lowest times, the one who had given birth to his sons."
"“Very well. The child may live in the palace.” He started, earning a sigh from the queen. “But,” he added. “You will be executed.”"
"A shared look of horror came from the advisor and Queen Eirwen herself. She slowly looked down at the floor. “Yes, my king.” She bowed."
"The Ice King ordered the royal advisor to take the queen’s daughter to one of Eirwen’s vacant rooms. Once that was done he ordered the guards to bring Eirwen to the execution site, where all the townspeople could see."
"As the guards escorted her to the site, the townspeople cried out in outrage at seeing their only queen- and the nicest one- about to be killed. Some people were crying, some people were shouting and trying to attack the guards, and others were wondering why this was happening; but they all shared the same basis."
“Let her go!”
“Why are they doing this to her?”
"As Eirwen approached the wooden pole, the most feared person in the kingdom showed up. The fire user. The former Queen Eirwen was going to be burned to death. Nobody deserved that death, not even the criminals. It was the most cruel thing you could do to a person in Frostfell."
"Eirwen was tied up to the wooden pole and the king started speaking about how the queen betrayed all of them. The people of Frostfell refused to believe it and never accepted his words. Then, the fire user lit the pole on fire, and a single tear rolled down the former queen’s face."
"“Live on, Kari.” That was the end of the reign of Queen Eirwen."
Silence in the Halls
"Tap, tap, tap was all you could hear from the farthest room on the left in the south wing of the eternally cold palace. The servants passing by always wondered what was in the room, scared of what was inside. Rumors danced around the halls by the maids. It was thought that the Ice King’s deceased wife, Eirwen, was in that room, waiting to be let out."
"They couldn’t be more wrong. Ivory thought, walking toward the south wing, as the help roamed the walls whispering to each other. They don’t know what’s in there at all."
"The rumors, of course, also applied to them as they were the only person allowed to enter the room."
"Knock knock. “Lady Kari, are you in there?” Ivory whispered to the intricate door, which was laid in snowflakes and a crown, the symbol of the royal family."
"They wondered if she would actually let them enter, unlike the previous times they went to ask. I still have a bruise from the last time. Ivory chuckled from the memory. Kari had thrown a book at their shoulder, but when she saw who it was, she apologized immediately."
"A single tap came from inside, seeming to say that she was there, after all, there was nowhere to go."
"“May I come in?” Ivory asked, remembering the time they went in without asking."
"One tap came from inside. Yes, it seemed to say. Ivory shivered, from the cold and the sound. It felt kind of weird to Ivory hearing a noise coming from a presumably vacant room, even though they have been going into there for years."
"“I’m coming in.” Ivory said, slowly opening the door. The sight they saw in the room was unusual , by normal people’s standards , but not unexpected. Papers were everywhere. Books were scattered about, the desk was broken, and there were multiple ice sculptures scattered about. There were no windows and little to no light. It was also colder than the rest of the palace (which was saying a lot). The room looked like a snowstorm blew it all out of place."
"The girl in the room was curled up onto her bed, currently wrapped in her comforter as she read one of her notebooks. A small lantern lighting up the space."
"“Which notebook is that?” Ivory asked, sitting down next to Kari on her bed."
"She flipped to a blank page and wrote the date on it. Under it, she wrote, “5/11/648 -12/13/648.”"
"“Reviewing old memories?” Ivory inquired, looking at the old notebook. Kari nodded. “Do you think that they will let you out for Christmas? It’s only a few days away.”"
"Kari tapped twice on the lantern. No, as Ivory predicted. The Ice King never let Kari out, as she was seen as “a flaw” in his eyes. She was born mute and was the only girl in her family, as it was all made up of boys."
"Ivory was too, in their own special way. When Ivory came out as nonbinary, it seemed like the world changed too. They were given the jobs that would make them spend time alone for most of the time, as a punishment for being different."
"They were also forced to work as the princess’ servant. They didn’t mind it much thought, as they got a friend too."
"“It’s your birthday soon, isn’t it?” Ivory asked, remembering that the princess’ birthday was in a few days. Kari nodded, a sad glint in her light blue eyes."
"“Do you want to celebrate?” They asked, reflecting on the last time she answered it."
"No. Kari tapped out. Ivory knew that it was a hard subject for her. It was the day that she was confined to her room and her mother was banished. Ivory was only a baby when it happened, but they remembered the outrage the servants and townspeople were in. They heard Queen Eirwen was a nice queen, but also weirdly predicted things that would happen."
"“So… whatcha wanna do?” They asked. Kari looked up at them, teeming with excitement. She handed Ivory a paper. When they looked down at it however…"
6in x 6in painting canvas
"White, varying shades of blue paint"
6 different sizes of paint brushes
Easel
"“You want me to get these things for you?” Ivory turned toward the silent princess, who was tapping a lot, pig tails swishing back and forth. “Yes?” They giggled slightly as they saw the normally withdrawn princess was passionate about something. It was the first time she had ever asked for something not related to books that was outside her room."
"“Okay! See ya later?” Ivory asked, standing up and weaving through the mess of papers and notebooks."
"Kari nodded, going back to reviewing her memories and curling up in her thick comforter."
"They exited the room, relieved that the princess was finally pushing out of her comfort zone and asking for things outside of her power, like paint."
"They walked through the halls again, trying to tune out the whispers of the maids again."
"“ I heard that she’s getting possessed by Queen Eirwen, that’s why she’s always going to that room.”"
“I heard that she eats children in that room.”
"“ She looks like a man, isn’t that wrong?”"
"They covered their ears, as tuning them out wasn’t working. They made their way to the royal painter’s room, which was on the east wing, second door on the left."
"Ivory approached the door that was just as intricate as Kari’s. On it was the White Dragon, one of the 6 primordial dragons, who allegedly created Frostfell. It would make sense for the painter to have it on his door though, he liked history."
"They opened the door, expecting the normal sight. Paint splotches everywhere, pencils and papers scattered across the room, easels covering up every last inch of wall. Unexpectedly, there was a different sight to be found. It was all clean, and there was a red velvet background and a stool in front of it. On the stool was Crown Prince Aquilo, getting his portrait done."
"“Ah, good morning, Ivory! Care to watch your future king get his portrait done?” Aquilo inquired, winking at Ivory."
"“Sorry, princey,” They said, partially ignoring him and searching for the things that their silent friend wanted. “I’m just here to get art supplies.”"
"“Aw baby girl’s gonna leave so soon?” Aquilo asked, “But I wanted to see you!”"
“Well I didn’t.” Ivory found the art supplies on their list and put it in a crate that they found. “And I’m not a girl.”
"The prince didn’t think this though. “Aw baby, you know it’s just a phase! You’re going to grow out of it when you’re older!” He said, slurring his words."
"“I have to go.” They said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable when the prince said back. Remembering all the bad things people said about their gender identity. I really want to get away from him."
"“Leaving so soon?” The prince instantaneously appeared at the door, ignoring the cries of one royal painter."
“This isn’t the way a future king should act!” They demanded.
"“Nobody’s gonna know. The people won’t believe you and the painter won’t say anything if he values his life.” He looked back at the painter for a second, then leaned closer to Ivory. “Whatddya say about going on a date?” They shivered. Sure, they had heard multiple threats in the past, but it had never come from a prince, let alone the one next in line to be king."
"“Do you even know what the word ‘no’ means?” They spat out, pushing the crown prince away from them."
"“Nope.” Aquilo answered back, smiling. Of course the crown prince who gets everything he wants doesn’t know what the word even means."
"Ivory rolled their eyes. “Why do you even want to go on a date with me of all people? You have like, I don’t know, 100 suitors?”"
"He cut in, still smiling, “500 actually.” He threw his hair back, swishing it in the cold air."
“See! Why me of all people? I’m the palace menace.” They hugged their arms.
“You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.” Aquilo puts one digit under their chin and forces Ivory to look up at him.
Chapter 1
Cohren
"0430 Itania time. Cohren hated waking up this early. Mainly because it was his responsibility to wake everyone else up in his company. Silently stepping out of his bunk, he put on his combat fatigues, throwing on his assault vest, and packed up his belongings from his locker, being careful with a particular small box. He shoulded his rifle and put his helmet on a small hook connected to his belt. It had all its fixing, respirator, goggles, everything needed. After checking his ammo pouches, he quietly walked out of the barracks, mud and ice squelching under his boots."
"He took a lighter from his jacket pocket and a cig from the other. Lighting it, he took a small drag before opening the door slightly. Over the last week he had to get creative when waking the men and women under his command. He stopped using the preset wake up alarm, half the time it never worked, when all that came from the speakers was a light hiss."
“Waking them up” Cohren turned to see 2nd Lieutenant Nemic walking up.
“Yup” Cohren responded.
“What did you plan on using this time?”
"Before he could answer, the door opened and Harris, Craith, and a few others hurried out, already fully dressed and kitted out."
"“Morning,” Craith said."
“What woke you guys up?” Cohren asked.
"“Well, One, we didn’t want to see what you had in mind for waking the company up today. Second, the first Shock Troops to get up get first pick of the morning chow” One of the men, Ravik, answered. “And you know for a fact how bad they can get”"
"“You make a good point Specialist,” Cohren said. He reached in and flicked a switch. An alarm sounded inside of the barracks, loud and screeching. He heard muffled shouting inside and people stumbling about."
"“Jeez Valturi,” Nemic stated. “You’d think they would have learned by now to wake up when you did”"
"“Well my buddys from boot camp here did” Cohren motioned to Harris, Craith and Ravik. “But then again, their squad and platoon leader’s, they know to wake up before their units."
"Seconds later the rest of the company came streaming out. They all had everything they needed, from personal items to needed gear. A few of the newer recruits look disoriented, others more annoyed."
“Morning everyone” Cohren said in a cheery voice.
"“With all respect sir, why do you have to wake us up like that?” One of the Shock Troopers, a corporal, asked."
“Cause the regular alarms are shit. And because Daybreak doesn't sleep in” Cohren stated.
"“Make sure you have all your personal belongings,” Cohren continued. As a 1st Lieutenant and Company XO, it was his responsibility to oversee and assist the company with the Company leader, Captain Boradin Shaw . “We won’t be returning. Sergeants and 2nd lieutenants, I'm giving you and your squads fifteen minutes to make final checks and grab rations for the day”"
"The members of Exodus company quickly dispersed. They were a part of the 2nd Shocktrooper Division, 2nd Army. They were originally two separate companies, Cohort and Dagger, before being consolidated. They were a cracked company, and Cohren felt mixed feelings about being promoted to 1st Lieutenant, mainly due to the reasons."
"Cohren and Nemic, the leader of 1st Platoon, walked together under the light of the FOB's many lights, powered by generators. Most were tinted red to help keep them hidden from enemy bombers. Daybreak had resorted to Wild Weasel attacks, both in the air and on the ground, to combat them."
"“Another day, another task for Hell’s Frontrunners” Nemic started with a dry laugh. “Where are they sending us?”"
"“A FOB outside Ianlos. We are being sent to help support the ground assault” Cohren answered, taking a drag from his cigarette. Half of him blamed Craith for getting him into smoking, but a year of combat does a lot to you, so he didn’t say anything."
"“Shit. Its getting bad on the front, '' Nemic muttered. “All the news leaving this place is ‘Support the war effort. Send aid to the Kurgan Front’ how about sending aid to the Howland Front”"
"“Amen brother” Cohren said as he flicked the remains of the cigarette into the mud. “Anyway, we're heading out with the 1st armored platoon, so we don’t have to walk. Captain Shaw should be their”"
"“Shaw got us a ride?” Nemic asked, a little surprised."
"“Yup. Honestly, he isn’t as bad as I thought he was. I mean, he’s not great, but he isn’t unbearable”"
"Cohren lifted his thumb and index finger to his throat mic, shifting his pack on his back while he did. “All units in Exodus Company, meet at Motor Pool West when you're finished. We are heading out with the 1st Armored Platoon at 0500”"
"Every few seconds he got a response from the squad leaders. Haris, Craith, and Ravik had all been low ranking NCO when they all got there. All four of them had been good friends since basic back on Earth. It felt so long ago now since Cohren had met them, even though it couldn’t have been two years ago. They were squad leaders, But Craith was now leading 2nd Platoon as of a week ago, after the previous leader had gotten medically discharged after catching a bullet from a Daybreak sniper."
"Walking up to the motor pool, Cohren and Nemic’s eye fell on a group of around eight Kronos Main Battle Tanks and four Strykers. Their crew milled about, making sure their war machines were ready to go. Cohren’s gaze soon found Captain Boradin Shaw, who was talking with the armored platoon’s commander. As they walked up, Shaw looked over and walked up, his usually cold face masking all emotions."
"“Lieutenant Nemic…Lieutenant Valturi…” He said Cohren was slower, glancing at Cohren’s pistol holster before glancing up again. “I assume that the company is ready”"
"“Yes sir. There should be on their way now, we gave them time to grab rations from the mess” 	At 0500 sharp, Exodus company assembled at the motor pool. Shaw stepped onto a box and began to speak."
"“Where are moving out to FOB I-131, fifty miles outside of Ianlos. We are to support the ongoing siege and later attack of Ianlos to flush out the insurgency there. From there we will have a foothold and the base of the mountains” Shaw explained. “Get with your squads and mount up”"
"The company dispersed, joining together in their squads and their sergeants had them mount up on one of the tanks. Cohren pulled himself onto one of the tanks farther up on the convoy, joining Nemic, Craith, and two new recruits. Cohren remembered them arriving a few days ago, but didn’t know much about them. Sitting on the side, dangling his legs on the side, he adjusted his pack and radio set, which connected to his earpiece and throat mic."
"“Hey Cohren, does Harris still have Snowball?” Nemic asks as they got settled in."
"“You mean his chicken he stole?” Cohren remembered the morning they had stolen him from a farm. “Yeah, i'm pretty sure”"
"Cohren glanced over to one of the other tanks and spotted Harris with his squad. From the back of his pack he could just make out the movement of a small chicken moving its head around, scanning the surroundings."
"“Yup, he still has him” Cohren answered as the tank's turret hatch clanked open and its commander came into view."
"“All tanks were moving out” The commander started calmly but clearly into his headset. The engines of a platoon of tanks and Strykers roared to life as they started moving forward. The Kronos Cohren was on jolted as its break released and moved forward, getting into formation. The tanks took up a wedge formation as they moved across the Itania plains. The winter storms had frozen over the wetlands and forests, but the mud always remained."
"After around an hour, one of the new recruits, Cohren, remembered his name being Orson, spoke up. “Lieutenant, you’ve been here since the start of the war, right?”"
"“Yup, Operation Firestorm,” Cohren answered. “We thought it would be over in a few weeks, but…we underestimate them”"
"“Underestimated is putting it lightly” Nemic joined in the conversation. “They had more weapons and manpower than we were prepared for. They were able to shoot down The UFS Revenant in the first two weeks, and just last month the Erebus. Hell, we should see it from the route were taking”"
"“Well, I’ll stand defiantly for the Federation” Orson said defiantly. “I’ll not let those terrorist scare me”"
"“You say that now, but from what I have seen, most fresh eighteen year old recruits like yourself dive to cover as soon as you hear a gunshot” Craith stated."
"“I guess we’ll find out,” Cohren said with a laugh. Orson didn’t continue the conversation."
"“Exodus XO, Exodus CO” Cohrens radio crackled. “We're picking up heat signatures 350 yards out, 20 degrees right”"
"Cohren pulled himself up to the top of the tank and pushed his Optic Goggles. Switching them to Thermal, he could see heat signatures in the distance."
"“Yup, I see them” Cohren responded, using his throat mic."
"“Enemy’s?” The other recruit, Natayla, asked."
"“Can’t tell,” Cohren stated. He reached for his mic and spoke. “Exodus Company, hold fire unless fired upon, let's draw them out"
"As they drew closer, the little heat signatures turned from blobs to more distinct shapes. As they drew closer, one of them ran for something and grabbed it before rusing back to the small ridge they were on. The figures dropped down into firing positions."
"“We got contacts” Shaw shouted through the radio as orange tracers fired from the ridge. Bullets pinged off the tanks side as Shock Troopers leaped off the tanks, taking cover behind them. An anti missile rocked, streaked by and slammed into the ground behind the formation, exploding and throwing debris onto one of the tanks. Another slammed into the side of a Stryker, a APS-Cerberus, and exploded. Its crew scrambled out and dove for cover as the ammo cooked off."
"“Iron 1-2 and 1-3, 25 degrees right, 300 yards. Open fire” The tank platoon commander shouted over the radio. Iron 1-2 and 1-3 opened fire, their shells streaking towards the ridge and exploded, sending mud and rock into the air."
"“Send in the Senti’s” Knoxx, who was watching the ridge through binocs, shouted. The back to one of the Cerberus’s opened and an unarmed soldier stepped out, wearing a special headset. He shouted orders into a square microphone and two Senti’s, formally known as Sentinels, rushed out. Their skinny metallic arms and legs swung forward as they broke into a sprint. They were armed, but their weapons were slung to their back."
“Kill or capture?” Craith asked as they watched.
"“Looks like capture” Cohren guessed as the two Sentinels disappeared into the cloud of ash and smoke. Shouting and gunshots echoed from the ridge, but quickly ceased. A moment later the two sentinels marched back, pulling someone behind them, their boots dragging behind them. When they reached the safety of the platoon they threw the figure to the ground, he grunted in pain as they landed hard in the mud and snow."
"Shaw walked up to the figure, who was starting to get up. He then turned to one of the Sentinels. “How many?”"
"“Three dead, sir” The Sentinel answered. “The rest fled on foot”"
"Shaw nodded and turned towards Cohren and Criath, who were standing close by. “Would you two be so kind as to stow this man away?”"

Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.
"With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country."
Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.
"A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency."
"The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties."
"It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was ""keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."""
"Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid."
"In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force."
"Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi."
He denies wrongdoing.
"The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized."
"In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel."
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.
"The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post."
"The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser."
"Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections."
"The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections."
"The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said ""refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."""
Android hardware Cleaning tip
Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.
"They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles."
I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions.
"After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair."
After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood.
"After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device."
And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions.
There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction.
"Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work..."
They work very VERY well!
"After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new."
"*I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product."
South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk
"South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy."
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.
"""He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness,"" De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees."
"I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him."
"A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers."
"Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions."
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
"De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority."
"Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, ""Justice denied"" and ""Justice for apartheid victims"" and were swiftly led away by police."
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.
"In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing."
"De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing ""for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done"" to South Africa's non-white populations."

"Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5"
"An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others."
"The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss."
"The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier."
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
"While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort."
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
"Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion."
"""Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest."
"They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred,"" DeBerry said"
"In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour)."
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.
"The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters)."
"""We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm."
"People got excited,"" DeBerry said."
"""We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."""
"Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares)."

"Oh, so glad you asked, I have a lot to say about this."
"Yes, there’s been a pretty drastic change."
"I have been overweight/obese since I was 3 years old, so existing like that is all I ever knew until age 30."
The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.
damn.
supportive.
"I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems."
"This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit."
"One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss."
"Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs."
"In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them."
"Unsurprisingly, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them."
"At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame."
"When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it."
"Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it’s in excess these days)."
The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.
"When I was bigger, people really didn’t pay me any attention."
"Like, little to no eye contact."
No saying hello or smiling at me as we pass on the street unless they knew me.
Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment me.
It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.
"I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about."
"Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it."
"I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project."
"Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc."
"Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that’s just platonically."
"Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol."
It is DAUNTING.
"I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience."
"It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually."
Huge shock to me.
"I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet” is NOT the way to go."
I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.
Hey r/Military!
I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.
Hello everyone!
"I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force."
Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.
"You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the ""reserve"" unit until you turn 60."
"In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year."
"However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission."
"If you want to do that, you have to join the ""scouts battalion"" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such."
I am just wondering how is it for other countries?
"If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?"
What do you guys think about mandatory military service?
"During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada."
"Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military."
"I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well."
Sorry for my poor grammar.
English is my second language.
You can also reset it from there.
"However I recommend you resetting it from your computer, even if you are logged in on your computer, this is for you to remember your password, as this information is important to know by memory"
"Once your password is reset from your computer, please try accessing once again on our daughter's e-reader with your new password"
please let me know if it works
I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried.
"Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills."
"While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,"
"I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life."
"To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward."
"Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity."
That's the thing.
"Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege."
"Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist."
"The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts."
But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.

Move the trailer!
"Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop."
"I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster."
"No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it."
The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something.
"Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella."
"The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly)."
Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster?
"Me: No, the owner drove yesterday."
"Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster!"
"Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it."
Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there.
You know we need to have access to the dumpster.
Me: but I didn’t park it there.
Why don’t you talk to the owner about it?
"Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah"
Me: It was not me.
"The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way."
"From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning."

"Family pays tribute to ""energetic"" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham"
"The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a ""young, energetic 18-year-old"" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist."
"Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said."
Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service.
"Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene."
A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest.
"A statement released on behalf of his family said: ""We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes."
We still don't know the reason he was killed.
"A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist."
The whole community are shocked.
"May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents."""
Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager.
"Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: ""Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him."
This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances.
There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible.
We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us.
"I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why."
"It's the least Yahya's family deserve."""
"Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10/12/21."
An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me.
"When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause)."
Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”.
I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car.
"A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental."
None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).
None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim.
They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage.
"Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department."
I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.
"If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care."

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions.
This isn't even necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now.
"> Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently."
Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough?
It also makes for some terrible UX.
"Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?"
"And what does ""the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release"" even mean?"
> This is in contrast to Google.
"Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share."
"I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps."
"That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is ""better"" for the developers, or the end user."

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
"Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games."
Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
"As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator."
"However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes."
"NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators."
"All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up."
"This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match."
"Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be ""huge risks"" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland."
"For your information, I will be sending you a transcript of our conversation."

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop.
My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.
These neighbors and I share a fence.
It separates our back yards.
"Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard."
"I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc."
but this dog is insane.
The maintenance guys are afraid of it.
So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill.
I can't even use my yard at this point.
"That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop."
I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence.
Owner says no.
I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.
Owner says no.
(Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.)
"Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan."
I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*.
"Like, I saved and invested in this."
"Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker."
"There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked."
"When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up."
My speaker shakes the table.
It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.
"The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it."
The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays.
Edit some grammar errors
"Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL."
This can seriously harm and even kill an animal.
"Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested."
"It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit."
"It sounds great for the money, though."
I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

Liz Truss pledges another £75m in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting
"A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced."
"The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and ""support stability in the region."""
"It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what co-ordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers."
"The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal."
"Ms Truss said: ""The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter."
"The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region."
"We are determined to do all we can for the people of Afghanistan."""
The additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
It will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.
"The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO)."
"Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations."
The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.
"David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would ""help us save many lives."""
"""What we are seeing on the ground is heart-breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis,"" he said."
"""Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."""
"This week the UN's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was ""happening before our eyes"" and urged the international community to take action to stop ""the freefall"" before it leads to more deaths."
"Martin Griffiths said: ""It's getting more and more dire by the week."""
The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.
"Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the ""dysfunctional"" and ""chaotic"" handling of the situation."
Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
"He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that ""considerable capacity"" was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul ""Pen"" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane."
"The Prime Minister has called the claims ""complete nonsense."""
"At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually."
"The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south-east Asia's ""economies of the future"" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said."
"The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a ""tilt"" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region."

"When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list."
You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag.
A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality.
"A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance."
Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available.
"Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow."
Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one.
Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole.
The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number.
"The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood."
"To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an ""anti-snag strip"" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip."
"Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners."
External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying.
"Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the ""mummy"" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used."
"Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area."
Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering)
"Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use."
Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort.

I was buying new tires.
I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website.
I printed out the page and took it to my local shop.
It was part of a chain.
The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout.
Don’t know where he got the higher price from.
"Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout."
"He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price."
He was gracious about it too.
Been buying tires from them ever since.

Russia warned of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacked
"The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement."
"US intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops."
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.
Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
"At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate."
"""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost,"" the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources."
"""We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future,"" the draft said."
"For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a ""red line"" it will not allow to be crossed."
Mr Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
"In 2014, Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to slap sanctions on Russia."
The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory.
"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow's ""red lines."""
"The G7 comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union."
"""We call on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities,"" the G7 said in the draft."
"""We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,"" the draft said."
China's Xi and Russia's Putin dominate the G7
Pope calls for 'serious international dialogue' to defuse Ukraine tensions
"Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, today called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict."
"He said he was praying for ""dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons."""
Weapons are not the path to take.
"May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine,"" the pope told thousands of people in St Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address."
"Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10% of the population in the former Soviet republic."
"Separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay ""a terrible price"" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine."

"Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU"
"Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border."
"He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office."
It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday.
"Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow."
Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues.
"The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there."
Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government.
"The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages."
"Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner."
The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.
"Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday."
She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage.
She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border.
Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries.
"On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels."
"Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure."
"His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats."
The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D
The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays.
"On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13."
These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.
"I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it."
How come we never saw the main shuttlebay?
It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility.
"Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13."
"In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life."
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.
Couldn't they have done this on TNG?
"We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part II,"" but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle."
"We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space."
"The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in ""Cause and Effect."""
"We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles."
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?

Is there anything else I can help you with?
I see it all the time in my line of work.
And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating.
Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life.
Peer to peer failed.
Insurance says it’s not medically necessary.
We appeal.
They say no again.
We go to third party appeal.
We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure.
"We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure."
"24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No."
Not medically necessary.”
My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE!
"But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”."
"Of course, they don’t."
And this kid is screwed.
No other option.
As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive.
"We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal."
Not this time.
The system is so broken.

How was the farewell to Etho was like?
First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife.
I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P)
Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right.
Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone.
I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way >.<...
So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day.
"Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc."
"While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history."
"Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial."
How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts.
"Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such."
Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things.
"Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms."
"This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me."
What I am after is the other side of the picture?
"As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff."
So how was the response from 'the old gang'?
Did you keep doing stuff together?
Did you slowly drift apart?
Still chat or invite one another to events?
"Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats."
Kinda the opposite.
"I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt."
P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected.
That's awesome as heck!
I apologize but we are unable to change the address once it has been placed already.
"In this case, what I suggest is you can call the rider once he is nearby already for you to be able to amend the address."
"To do this, simply access your order page, tap 'Help and support' and choose the option 'Call rider'."
did you sign out and sign in on your app?
did you do the 2 procedures?
if you did both procedures and didn't solve the issue I can refund the money to your Store Credit account.
that way you can buy the book of your choice immedialtrely.
would that be okay
are you there?
for quality purposes i will have to release this chat if there is no interaction in the next 2 minutes

"I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening."
The counter people were the worst I have ever seen.
A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here.
I had a confirmed reservation went.
"After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off."
"I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away."
I swore to never use Avis again.
Worst car experience ever.
National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me.
"Those two, followed by Enterprise."
Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter.
I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague.
"It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities."
French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.
"The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough."
"Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests."
"""Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports,"" the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement."
"The group said its members were ""exasperated"" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt ""betrayed"" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue."
"The CRPMEM said the protests would be ""in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26."""
"On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link."
Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.
"Therefore, we are prepared to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have before placing an order or after you have received your order."

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought.
"I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither."
"After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help."
"Should we just keep allowing them to ""audit"" votes until they get the results they want?"
>This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi.
This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die.
"No, it's not."
"This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to ""study"" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller."
"If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit."
Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated.
">At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong."
We've already done this.
Twice.
It hasn't stopped them.
And it's not like this is harmless.
There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots.
Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match.
"How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded?"
"How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know?"
And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time?
I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

"Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says"
"Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries."
"Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations."
"""Time is running out,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting."
It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress.
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months.
"The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi."
"Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a ""productive"" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks."
"A senior State Department official said there was an ""intense"" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks."
"""The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that,"" the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said."
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.
"Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions."
"The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies."

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak
"Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club."
"Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday."
"It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground."
"Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday."
"The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool."
"Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat."
"Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results."
Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed.
"Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result."

"Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop."
It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone.
Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be.
We treat the disabled like crap.
We treat the poor like crap.
Everyone in the US should be ashamed.
You're correct that our society needs to value human life more.
"If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down."
We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths.
"Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on."
"Unfortunately, American society has ""accepted"" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just ""a way of life""...in exchange for ""freedom"" or some such BS."
I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people.
"It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict."

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw
A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world.
"""The internet's on fire right now,"" said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike."
"""People are scrambling to patch,"" he said, ""and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it."""
"He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been ""fully weaponised,"" meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it."
The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years.
It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government.
"Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more."
Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability.
"""I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk,"" said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors."
"Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days."
"Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it ""the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade"" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing."
"The vulnerability, dubbed ""Log4Shell,"" was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software."
Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software.
Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous.
"New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being ""actively exploited in the wild"" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released."
"The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said."
It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.
Have a great day
Thank you for taking the time to chat to me today.
Once this chat has ended you will be sent a 'rate my chat' feedback email.
"Please kindly fill this in if you have a moment, however if you don't have time then may I wish you a wonderful day and thank you again."
Yep…we guys all have guns.
Even babies.
We all walk around with them like it’s the Wild West.
I don’t even know where to begin here.
"You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo?"
A crack head is not a “professional mugger.”
"If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what?"
Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings.
Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it’s not happening.
WTF does this have to do with race?
Missed Out on Shiba Inu?
EverGrow Might Be The Next Big Crypto To Explode in 2022
"Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation."
A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!
"Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble."
"Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO (fear of missing out) to pile into the meme-coin."
"Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design."
"In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future."
"Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so."
"There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack, and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value."
"Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts."
One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
"In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1-to-1 with the USD."
"The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan."
"With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors."
"With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project."
"Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation."
"Yesterday, CoinMarket Cap placed an alert on EverGrow's page, confirming that the data error had been fixed."
"The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows."
"However, EverGrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error."
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
"In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors."
Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
"With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap."
"If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022."
There's a circularity to it...
I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition.
The math they do is just crazy.
"""We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..."" Madness."
"I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth."
"Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper."
The problem is that we sold out the people below us.
I agree with you.
Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better.
"Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone..."

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas
Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus.
So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers.
But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view.
My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic.
"Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance."
On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not.
"What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child?"
I dread to think.
I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing.
For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right.
"It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020."
AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven.
"Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing."
Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report
Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
"The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization."
POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.
"Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus."
"According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect ""Stealth Omicron,"" which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests."
"Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test."
"In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot."
"The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology."
"The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection."
"According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes."
"In the case of ""Stealth Omicron,"" both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants."
"The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently."
"Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour)."
"In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily."
"As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future."
"""I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible,"" said Professor Lee."
We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.
This technology is currently before commercialization.
"However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed."
"Professor Lee said, ""I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials."
"The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."""
I told ya so....
The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
"Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was."
"Needless to say, it was chaos."
"At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was."
"I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks?"
straws?).
"Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her ""I believe they are now on aisle 7."""
"Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off."
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there.
"A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not."
"He looks confused and says ""OK, maybe they are on 8."
"I'll help you find them, ma'am."""
"As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says ""You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know""."
"Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line."
"As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me ""They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her."""
HA....told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment).
"Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold."
"If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?"
Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied?
Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice!
I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick.
"The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation."
It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.
Iran reports lowest number of daily COVID-19 cases in more than one year
"Iran's Health Ministry has registered 1,686 new daily COVID-19 infections, the lowest tally over the past 460 days, marking a sharp decline in cases as the fifth wave of the pandemic subsides."
"According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital."
"It added that 6,152,524 people in the country have contracted COVID-19 and 5,963,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals."
"According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units (ICU) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran."
Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign.
"So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots."
"The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses."
"Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead."
"According to the latest figures, eight cities are in the orange zones, 119 in the yellow category, and 321 cities are in blue zones."
There is no city in the high-risk red zone.
Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said on Wednesday that the country is fully prepared to roll out coronavirus booster vaccinations.
"""Today there is neither concern nor any shortage in the supply of vaccine and the ground is ready for the third and fourth dose vaccinations,"" Mokhber added."

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course
I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course.
The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module.
Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only.
The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth.
"I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules."
"The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course."
"If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online."
Here is the course intro

The lining may be a lighter or darker colour to the one shown in the images.
Please write to us to know the current stock color.
Genuine leather might have very small cut / scars / mark on it.
This does not mean it is damaged.
There may also be visible creases in the leather.
"These features show the genuine origin of our leather satchels and messengers bags, they form part of the bag and do not affect its durability."
Pure leather may smell a little when it is fresh but the smell will go away with use.
Please keep it in sunlight and fresh air for a few days.

Buyers are responsible for CUSTOMS at destination.
You know something.
I get what Dave's point was.
It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people.
And of course that's true.
But Dave forgot something.
Many people who hate trans people also hate black people.
He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter.
He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric.
He's given credibility to transphobia.
"And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence."
"He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him."
How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.
"You're welcome, one moment please."
"I've ordered a replacement item for you, this is scheduled to dispatch on February 19."
I will just arrange a returns label for you now.
A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee.
"So to note, I didn’t witness this."
I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job.
These two guys came to the store.
One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law.
"After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it."
"This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door."
"Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid."
"When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him."
"I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle."
"I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on."
"But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set."
"He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off."
I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past.
"If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs,"
we might be able to help!
Depending on the company.
I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by.
"I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then ""remit"" that deduction back to you separately."
I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course.
"Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're ""trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!"""
"We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed."
Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services.
"These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons."
It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps.
Some gyms let you rent lockers.
"Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some."

Dishwasher.
First shift they had me close.
Saturday.
We were working till past 1am.
I quit the next day.
"Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that."
"Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot."
They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row.
He quit.
"Unless you advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose your workers if you hit them with it too early."
I can see that you've ordered from a restaurant that does their own delivery.
They have accepted your order which is #PRS_ORG#.
The restaurant called you and they do not have the item that you ordered?
"Regrettably this is currently out of stock, I will just see if this is returning."
Please bear with me a moment
"This has been discontinued so will not be returning to stock, we do apologize."
Boris Johnson teeters on edge of favour with Tory MPs
Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks.
And some Tory MPs hope he'll continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.
The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.
First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year.
"Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface."
"When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however."
"The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households."
But it could have been worse.
"There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times."
Ministers will quietly breath a sigh of relief no pictures of these scenes have been leaked - yet.
"While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic."
"The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen."
"On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson ""thanking his staff"" and used it to play down the party scandal as ""hype."""
"He told LBC: ""On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."""
"Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a ""one rule for them"" narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson."
"Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge."

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters
"Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK."
They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march.
"Banksy designed the limited edition ""souvenir shirts"" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year."
"""All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint,"" the artist wrote on Instagram."
"Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it."
An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.
"UK media reported that ""thousands"" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with ""Bristol"" written above it."
"It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade."
"The activists, known as the ""Colston Four,"" are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council."
"The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue ""without lawful excuse."""
"Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city."
"The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march."
A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.
Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados
President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states.
"""We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming."
"Everything,"" he said."
"""And obviously it has some impact here."""
"At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm."
"The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the ""largest tornado outbreaks in history."""
He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate.
"""All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet,"" Biden said."
The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change.
"""As usual, you ask always the best question,"" he said with a wry chuckle."
"""How are we going to handle this?"" he continued."
"""Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen."""
"Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution."
"""So we have to act,"" he said."
Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms.
"""I promise you."
Whatever is needed.
"Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it,"" Biden said."
He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government.
"""I want folks in all these states to know."
We're going to get through this.
"We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away,"" he said."
"""This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans."""
The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts.
"""I do plan on going,"" he said."

"Wendy Rogers Calls New Zealand PM 'Lenin With Hair,' Claims 'Satanic Communists' in U.S."
"Republican Arizona Senator Wendy Rogers on Sunday called New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ""Lenin with Hair"" and warned against communism in the United States."
Rogers appeared to be criticizing Ardern's COVID response as she referred to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in a Tweet she posted along with a short clip of the prime minister.
Rogers didn't further explain her criticism of Ardern in her Tweet.
"In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID misinformation and New Zealand's efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic."
"""More bold Christians are needed in office to counter the satanic Communists in both parties,"" the Arizona Senator wrote in another tweet on Sunday."
"Her Tweet was met with ridicule from different social media users, with one person tweeting back: ""Please offer your definitions of Communism and Christianity, because I don't think you understand either."""
"""I see that Wendy is going all out today, trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy,"" another person tweeted."
Rogers has been vocal about her stance against communism before on social media.
"In September, she called Labor Day a ""Communist Holiday"" without further explanation."
"Her tweet was mocked among social media users, including The Arizona House Democrats, who replied: ""Says the heart and soul of Arizona's Republican Party (prove us wrong)."""
"""You do realize that if you keep falsely calling all good things communist you're only going to make communism more attractive, no?"" asked another social media user."
"Republican Senator Wendy Rogers warned against communists in America and called for having more ""bold Christians"" in office."
"Writer Shiv Ramdas also denounced the tweet by paraphrasing her own words: ""'working is Communism.'"""
"Separately, Rogers has frequently suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and called for a new election."
"""I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be conducted."
"Arizona's electors must not be awarded fraudulently..."" the senator tweeted in July."
"In July, Rogers campaigned for the election to be decertified and previously launched a petition that she claimed gained 663,000 signatures."
"""Things are really taking off!"
Let's get to 1 million ASAP.
"Audit results are coming soon, more states are coming online,"" she tweeted in September."
The Trump supporter has also pushed for debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Newsweek contacted Senator Rogers' office for comment.
"Thank you, please bear with me a moment whilst I look into this for you"
"I do apologise about this, as the account holder is not yourself we would need #NAME# to contact us to confirm her details, once she has done this and has confirmed she is happy for us to discuss the order with yourself we can then look at the previous correspondence for you."

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80
"She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said."
"Rice's biggest success was her first novel, ""Interview with the Vampire,"" which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018."
"""I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do,"" Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010."
"""Interview with the Vampire"" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series ""The Vampire Diaries"" and the ""Twilight"" film series."
"Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography."
"Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died."
"Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said."
Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size
"Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage."
Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage.
"I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone."
"I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case."
"After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data."
"After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do."
"I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable."
"Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue."

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2?
"Specifically 2.10 ""Over"""
"Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting."
Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this?
"Fed up completely, she asks ""Are you even going to work today?"""
"A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time."
"I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations."
I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday.
"Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs."
Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time.
I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son.
He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person!
He clearly sucks at damage control.
"Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes."

that's different.
Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?
"Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned."

"If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all."
It might just narrow your deficit that one day.
An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though?
That’s a no go.
"If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place."
Maybe start with 300 deficit.
Hope this helps!

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system
"I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories."
Not much to say here.
"The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly."
"I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them."
"“Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.”"
"To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular."
"I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on?"
Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline?
"“Sure, OP."
I am saving money to move.”
This is really rare.
"My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever."
Where is she moving?
To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry.
I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer!
"It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work."
So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city.
"She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine."
"Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position."
Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests
Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago.
"Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act."
"Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act."
"The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence."
"Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and ""nationalist organisations"" must take the lead in resuming the movement."
"Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, ""We can't expect them to organise agitations."
"Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement."""
"All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground."
"Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, ""It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out."
It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns.
We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again.
"We won't let the sacrifices go in vain,"" he said."
Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019.
"Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU."
"""We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure."
"The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it,"" he said."
"Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed ""black day"" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament."
This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring
Got just the one Christmas tree?
Then you could be behind the times.
"This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring."
"More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol."
Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia.
"Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours."
"Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire."
"Last week, she posted on Instagram: ""Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself."""
British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites.
"Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: ""People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees."""
Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more.
"Chairman Sarah Squire said: ""They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep."""
"Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber."
"Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: ""Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response."
"In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state."""
He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era.
"""Christmas can be a pretty stressful time."
A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things.
"That is always good for sleep."""

Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13-7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
"And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway."
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.
"Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team."
"Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench."
"Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks."
"For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear."
"Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle."
"And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening."
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.
"Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck."
"Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary."
"It concluded an exhilarating spell of end-to-end rugby in which the rivals took it in turns to attack from deep and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow."
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13.
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing a brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
"Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score."
France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece
"The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already ""signed"" and ""final"" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates."
"France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been ""initialled a few days ago,"" before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates."
"Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table..."
We also signed the contract with the Greeks.
"Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was ""final,"" since it had been negotiated at the ""highest level possible"" and ""personally announced"" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis."
"The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament ""soon."""
"The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates."
"The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction ""deal of the century"" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning."
"Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a ""stab in the back,"" while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to ""stop being naive"" while touting the new deal as a sign of ""Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."""
"This time around, according to the French military, the US ""had warned us that this announcement was going to come out"" and that Americans allegedly had ""no inclination to go further"" with an actual sale of their frigates."
Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help
I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders.
"I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question."
I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc.
"I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question."
"He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping."
"He then said ""hello?"" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily."
"I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone."
"I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it."
"He then just said ""forget it"" angrily and walked away."
How was I supposed to have known he needed help?
"He just said ""hello"" which plenty of customers say to be polite."
"This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help."
"He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him."
Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans
"Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation."
Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings.
Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power.
There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow.
"Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported."
A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall.
Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital.
"Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued."
"Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency."
"The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes."
Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road.
"Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said."
"Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow."
The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas.
An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning.
Many roads were temporarily blocked by landslides in the south.
"Elsewhere in the northeast and southeast of the country, heavy snow has hampered or temporarily blocked traffic."
We had power go out a couple of times.
Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately.
They are security now.
Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands).
Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there.
Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again.
Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave.
As well as every cart brought to the front.
Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.
Step 6: Return said cold/produce.
"Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc."
Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out.
"(Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go)."
"It's really dark, even upfront."
No way can we let customers just hang out.
I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't.
"Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay."
"I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later."
One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on.
"They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen."
"I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could."
"Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line."
This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia
"The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced."
"""We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation],"" Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic."
"According to the official, ""relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic."""
He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE.
"The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy."
"""If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000,"" Al Zeyoudi stated."
"According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list."
"In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week."
"According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles."
"Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up"
The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys.
"After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game."
"When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks."
"The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning."
"Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury."
The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity.
"This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players."
Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups.
It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88).
"Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands."
"Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, ""We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts."
"We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area."
"Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."""
Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life'
"Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected."
"The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning."
"The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a ""danger to life"" and causing damage to buildings."
"Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services."
"It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country."
"More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27."
"Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7."
STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row.
"The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers."
"The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute."
"""Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts,"" Philip said."
A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland.
"""This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas,"" Philip said."
"""It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime."
"For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."""

The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.
"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented."
"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."
"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."
But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.
"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."
"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support."
Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.
Scientific facts result from experiments.
"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."
"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise."
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.
"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."

#Venting into the Fediverse time.
The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub.
"When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman."
"Me, in board shorts and a wife beater, and The Domestic Partner, all tatted up and with a new haircut that he himself described as ""making me look like a neo-nazi""."
Her body immediately stiffened and there was this look of fear in her eyes.
And then we just... paid for our stuff.
And said thank you.
And I said her nails looked cool.
The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.
This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.
"Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell."
"If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison."
But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.
It takes the state's governor.
The two states involved are New York and Georgia.
The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis.
NY is the best hope for accountability
There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.
"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario."
"In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence."
"At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings."
"We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end."
"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."
"We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts."
"The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy."
I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.
"Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming."
Communities gain the knowledge to embed and support their own development.
I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects.
"When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support."
Thousands of trees have been established and farmers have seen increased crop yields through a range of interventions from support with equipment purchases to training.
"Nicholas is working with farmers to reduce pesticide use while finding ways to address the issues caused by climate change and pests such as fall armyworm, which can devastate maize crops."

The UPS store near me won't allow me to write a label or write on the box.
The must print the label.
They won't allow me to tell them the address it's going to and who is shipping it.

"And they always to charge me $2.25 for that ""convenience""."
The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night.
"It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies & grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media."
THE SHAMEFUL AUDIENCE.
Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience!
Who vetted & chose the individuals?
There's a story to be reported there.
The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all.
It can't be repeated.
"I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge."
"There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather."
"Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean."
"I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them."
It worked.
"(fwiw, I've tried nearly every ""humane"" trap on the market with very little success."
"I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)"
I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business.
"They aren't, at least not in Alberta."
Sure they cut business taxes.
But they also cut grants and tax credits that encourage more business activity.
"I own a business. It's successful in spite of the provincial government, not because of it."
"Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet."
"Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads."
"I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away."
"This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me."
"On the first train today, the ticket checker looked at our tickets and said ""long journey!"""
"""Yeah and I'm coming back today,"" I said."
"""I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,"" I attempted to explain, gesturing at my traveling companion."
"""There's not something you hear a lot 'I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,' "" the ticket guy said."
It's a thing I've never said before either.
The thing that last night convinced me of is that we need to be ready to fight back against Trumpism.
Trumpism is a cult.
"It is a cult that nobody really wants, except for the fanatics who are in it."
And they are truly nuts.
We can not allow them to hijack our country.
It is time to fight back.
Go out and protest now.
Get some bumper stickers that are anti-Trump and plaster them all over.
Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.
This is not normal.
This is not OK...
My neighbor & I arrived home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a covid mucus storm from across the street.
So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat.

It is not socially acceptable to go out in public or rush up to people when you are coughing up a mucus storm.
I repeat. It is not socially acceptable to spread your covid mucus storm everywhere!!!

One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.
"Forget me, fine."
"Ignore me, fine."
It hurts but you gotta do you.
But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse.
That takes effort.

I gripe about dad-ification a lot.
Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:
"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."
The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.
"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring."""
"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."
"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."
"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."

Been toying with this thought for a little while:
"Mental health is often seen as something separate from ""regular"" health."
Why?
Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.
"In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot."
"Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible."
"In the same way that mental health is seen as less ""real"" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind."
"The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of ""My sex is male, my gender is female"" seems simplistic and inaccurate."
It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.
"I feel that to be trans is to be ""biologically non-binary""."
"My sex is non-binary, my gender is female."
"I think the designation of ""non-binary"" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex."

There are still going to be jobs that can be accomplished remotely for the foreseeable future.
Remote work is enabling.
"It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices."
It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space.
It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.

"So like from the beginning for all my birthdays in the past, I always had rough ones."
Whenever May would pop up I dreaded trying to celebrate my bday.
"Something would always happen, go wrong, or just end up stressful and depressing."
I fought over the years to get out of that mindset and to have better bdays.
It took years of changing my life and working hard but finally...
I'm starting to smile and enjoy my bday with no worries.
And today is already becoming a great day!
Winter is 30 days away in this little part of the Great Southern World.
But I can't be deceived!
This is the beginning.
"The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it!"

It's 2023 and I still see people with iPhones actively avoid using Apple Maps.
"Apple Maps comes default with iOS, and yet people would go out of their way to download and install Google Maps onto their iPhones."
No idea why.
"Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare, on my test iPhone device (my daily driver is an Android device, so it's rare that I use an iPhone)."
The experience having to follow directions was far superior on Apple Maps compared to Google Maps.
Apple Maps wins.
So why is it that people jump through extra hoops to install Google Maps?
No idea.
Could it be that Google Maps got to market first?
Was it the 2012 Apple Maps disaster?
Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?
No idea.
"That said, I'm biased."
"I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012."

But it's the land that makes it a good storer of wealth for as long as you think the government isn't going to change the system we live in.
The house itself declines in value because it loses its condition and needs to be replaced.
A lot of ppl think that they literally own the earth when they buy a piece.
Not the case.
In China you can only lease land.
They're not stupid enough to sell the sell forever.
The government can change these policies whenever it wants.
The land is temporary.
It seems inconceivable that land may be taken away one day when you watch Australian and United States media channels but that's because the rich are on there all day ensuring your mind thinks a certain way.
The land is very easily and quickly taken away by the government one day if they want to do that.
And guess what?
It never made sense how ppl can keep land at the expense of others.
It has to be taken away one day.
That's why the Chinese only allow leases.
They already ran out of land.

I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.
"To agonize over personal failure & guilt in a world where ""success"" is so often bestowed on people responsible for the most reprehensible acts..."

Police arrest 15 after violent protest outside UK refugee hotel
The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats.
Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool.
The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley.
The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire.
"The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained ""following violent disorder."""
"Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, ""It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."""
"The Home Office has been using the hotel to temporarily house asylum seekers since last year, according to local media."
"George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the UK Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community."
"""The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety,"" he said."
"""Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community."""
The protest took place amid heightened tensions as growing numbers of refugees and migrants cross the Channel in small boats.
"More than 45,000 people reached the UK by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum."
"The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many asylum seekers stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodations."
"The Channel crossings have become a political issue, with the Conservative government promising to ""stop the boats"" and pursuing a plan to send such asylum seekers to Rwanda."
Opponents have accused the government of demonising desperate people fleeing war and poverty.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell
Derry midfielder Adam Reilly closes down Lee Grace at the Brandywell
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they ran out 2-0 winners over Shamrock Rovers.
The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's league winners at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy.
The Hoops pushed to reduced terms in the second half but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges stood firm to win the curtain-raiser.
Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday.
Patching's side-footed volley nudged Derry in front after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring as the Foylesider's ran out 2-1 winners over the eventual champions last February.
The Hoops went on to win the Premier Division by 13 points but Duffy soon had City further ahead with a long-range effort which managed to squirm under keeper Leon Pohls and into the net.
Last season's runners-up were two goals to good at the break.
Graham Burke went closest to reducing the arrears in the second period but the Candystripes were comfortable winners a week prior to their quest for national glory.
"City boss Ruaidhri Higgins praised his team after what he said was the ""hardest week of my life"" following the death of his brother Kevin."
"""It's a kick in the teeth and there's tough weeks ahead but we'll get on with it in his memory,"" said Higgins."
"""To beat Shamrock Rovers and deservedly so with a good performance is really pleasing."""
DHS hires law firm to handle possible Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment proceedings
"The Department of Homeland Security has hired an outside law firm - Debevoise & Plimpton - to assist in possible impeachment proceedings for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, as he potentially faces charges by House Republicans regarding his handling of the southern border."
"""The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday."
"""DHS will continue prioritizing its work to protect our country from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, and secure our borders while responding appropriately to the over 70 Congressional committees and subcommittees that have oversight of DHS."""
A DHS official tells CBS News the department has hired the firm for contracted work for the life of the congressional inquiry.
Debevoise was chosen because of its expertise in impeachment and bipartisan experience in working with Congress on oversight.
"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks during a joint news conference with Mexican officials at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2022."
OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images
The Justice Department recently advised that the contract with Debevoise qualifies as an appropriate expenditure for DHS.
DHS is trying to ensure that its mission isn't undermined by partisan attacks and that proceedings against Mayorkas are being handled by people with the appropriate expertise.
"Mayorkas has not commented on this development, but asked about the impeachment inquiry last Thursday, he told reporters, ""We will cooperate with this Congress, just as we did with the last Congress. I think that's our responsibility."""
"He conceded that ""it will take time"" to comply with the House's investigation."
"""I will spend that time as will others and we will also not compromise the time that we spend in fulfilling our mission."""
A DHS senior official confirmed that Mayorkas has not yet met with his new outside counsel.
"Only one cabinet member has ever been impeached, Secretary of War William Belknap."
"In 1876, Belknap, who served in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, was accused of accepting bribes but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate."

Four teens charged in attack of 14-year-old who died of suicide after beating video was posted online
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school 02:33
Four New Jersey teenagers have been charged in connection with the attack of a 14-year-old girl who later took her own life after video of the incident was posted on social media.
"One juvenile is charged with aggravated assault, two juveniles are charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one juvenile is charged with harassment, Ocean County prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer told CBS News in an email."
"Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her Bayville home on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online."
"The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teen, then kicking and dragging her down school hallways."
They pushed Adriana into red lockers lining the school hallways and one of the girls in a pink shirt punched Kuch repeatedly.
Another girl outside of the video frame laughed as she recorded the scene.
"Two adults came in to break up the attack, with one adult pulling the teens apart."
Adriana lay hurt and bruised on the hallway floor as the adult tried to help her up.
"One of the girls said, ""That's what you get."""
"""She loved life. She was the happiest kid. Everybody loved her,"" her father, Michael Kuch, told CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he's angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teens did to his daughter."
14-year-old Adriana Kuch died of suicide after a disturbing video of her being attacked at school was posted online. CBS2
"Kuch said police should have been called immediately because the students, who he said his daughter had been having problems with, smashed her face with a 20-ounce bottle."
"""If they called the police and did an investigation, those girls would not have posted videos from school,"" Kuch said."
"He also said his daughter, who had bruises on her body, should've been taken to the hospital."
"""We always address every issue of bullying and on the day of the incident four students were suspended,"" Dr. Triantafillos Parlapanides, superintendent of schools, told CBS New York."
School officials told CBS New York that they notified the family and called Adriana's death horrible.
"Each teenager and their guardian was served with a copy of their complaint and were released pending future court appearances, the prosecutor told CBS News."
Students at the school staged a walkout Wednesday in support of Adriana's family.

"I talked to 30 health, wellness professionals about avoiding burnout"
"In our day-to-day lives, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs."
"This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: ""How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?"""
Their careers range from infectious disease doctors to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice to give on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling.
"Despite the large differences in their roles, there were several themes within their responses that stood out as ways to prevent burnout."
Here are the top four approaches that they use.
1.Build a strong community
"As someone who works with patients who have terminal illnesses, Eufrosina Young thanks her strong support system for her ability to maintain her energy."
"Young is a board-certified neurologist and ALS specialist at the Upstate University Hospital's department of neurology, and says they ""mobilize like an army of people"" there."
"There isn't a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but knowing that she isn't the only one putting in the hard work to develop treatments and provide better options for her patients, keeps Young going even on her hardest days."
"""We're not carrying the weight of the world, but being part of a world of people that are advocating for this work,"" she says."
2.Rest when you need to
"Working two jobs as a sleep researcher and an algorithm engineer, all while taking care of a new baby, would have definitely led Raphael Vallat to burnout if he didn't rest, he says."
"""I feel like when I'm about to burn out, basically every task feels like a mountain that you need to climb, and feels super urgent and important,"" says Vallat."
"In those moments, ""you really need to take some time off and realize that these tasks can wait."""
"Typically, Vallat finds moments in his day where he can pause and spend time in nature to ground himself before returning to work."
3.Be passionate about what you're doing and remember your purpose
"Up until spring of 2022, infectious disease specialist Céline Gounder worked 100 hours a week for seven days a week."
"Being on the frontlines during the pandemic ate up almost all of her time, but she avoided burnout by reminding herself about why her work is important."
"""I don't think work feels like work when you feel like you're having an impact,"" says Gounder."
"""If you're working crazy hours doing something that has no meaning to you, I think you really do need to step back and question what you're doing."""
4.Have other joys
"Across the board, each of the experts said they engage in some hobby like exercise, dancing and even playing the guitar."
"It's extremely important to have a life you enjoy that exceeds what you accomplish in your job, says Christina Maslach, social psychologist, retired professor of psychology at U.C. Berkeley and author of ""The Burnout Challenge: Managing People's Relationships with Their Jobs."""
"""Look at your life as a whole, and make sure there's good things about it, and make sure you have time for them."""

Juvenile charged with murder in December Chicago school shooting that left 2 dead
"A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday."
"The suspect is charged with two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony attempted murder, Chicago Police superintendent David Brown announced."
"""We currently don't have a clear motive for why a 16 year old would want to shoot and kill other kids,"" Brown said."
"The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult."
Four teenagers were shot December 16 at Benito Juarez High School.
"The victims who died were both boys, aged 14 and 15, police announced at the time."
"Investigators say tips from the public helped lead them to the suspect, who was arrested Thursday."
"""We are grateful for those who have been brave enough to come forward to ensure that the offender is caught and will now be held accountable,"" said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx."
"The suspect is expected to appear in Bond Court Saturday, Brown said, where more details about the evidence they have collected will be presented."
Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch.
"The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department."
"But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department."
Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear.
"The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, ""examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep,"" according to the Facebook post."
The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation.
The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.
The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals.
"If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities - not try to move or feed the sleeping giant."
"In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food."
"But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, ""because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite."""
"Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources."

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery have been inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work.
"The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt Mostafa Waziri, Ambassador of Span to Egypt Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino."
"Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered through the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission from the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, working since 2002."
"He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor."
"They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies and a funerary garden."
Important tombs from an important era
"Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent people, who lived during the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt."
"He said that the layout of the tombs are T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th dynasty."
"These consistent of an entrance, a column hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls featuring distinct inscriptions."
Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.
"Djehuty was also responsible for recording Hatshepsut's journey to Puntland, and providing electrum (a mixture of gold and silver) for covering the top of the obelisks that she placed in the Karnak temples."
"In addition, he was in charge of the process of moving the obelisks."
"The room that precedes the Djehuty's burial chamber features inscriptions engraved with 43 chapters of the Book of the Dead, the first time that the chapters of the book were written on the walls of tombs before being written on linen and papyrus."
"Hery, held the position of superintendent of the royal stores of the sacred royal wife and mother, Ahhotep."
"Jared O'Mara should never have been a Labour candidate, says Rachel Reeves"
"The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara ""should never have been selected as a Labour candidate"" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said."
"Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election."
"The entire selection committee in Bolton North East resigned after they were not allowed to choose the shortlist, an increasingly common practice in Keir Starmer's Labour party, saying: ""Yet again, it appears that the Labour party is seeking to promote the views and attitudes of a clique in London, rather than local members in the north."""
"They added: ""This goes against the attitude necessary to win back the red wall, which is so desperately needed to deliver a Labour government."""
"Reeves said: ""I don't know what the circumstances are of what has happened in Bolton, but I do know that those being selected are strong candidates, often with very strong roots in their communities."""
"There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions."
"Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: ""I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."""
"O'Mara was imprisoned for four years this week after a jury found he had submitted fake expense claims totalling £52,000 in an attempt to fund his cocaine and alcohol abuse."
"Many people have suggested he was not properly vetted by Labour when he was selected to fight Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in Sheffield Hallam in 2017""s snap general election."
"Asked if the O'Mara debacle was looming large in the minds of Labour's NEC, Reeves said: ""I don't want to suggest in any way that anyone not on a shortlist is a cocaine user."
But Jared O'Mara was a terrible case.
He should never have been selected as a Labour candidate; he should never have been an MP.
"He used public money, it's absolutely right he's received his sentence."""
"The O'Mara circumstances were ""pretty exceptional,"" said Reeves, but she acknowledged: ""There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates."
"But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect."""
"She added: """"One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."""

"Reeves was in Bolton to meet apprentices at a training centre for Openreach, which provides the UK's broadband network."
"After watching apprentices climb up pretend telegraph poles at the £1.7m site, Reeves discussed Labour's plans to overhaul the apprenticeship levy, which forces larger firms to put aside 0.5% of their payroll to fund apprentices."
"Businesses complain the levy is too inflexible. For example, said Reeves, Openreach ""wants to retrain people who work on copper to work on fibre, but the apprenticeship levy doesn't have that flexibility around retraining."""
Reeves said Labour would change the levy so companies could use the money to retrain employees in industries such as the automotive sector and those currently fitting gas boilers.
"""We need them as part of the energy transition to net zero to be learning the skills to work on electric vehicles or fitting heat pumps or hydrogen boilers."
We want those people to be retrained to get the skills that they need to succeed.
And yet the apprenticeship levy is stacked up against them.
"Businesses want greater flexibility and young people starting off in life or older people who want to retrain to make sure that their skills are relevant for the future,"" said Reeves."
One arrested amid Tate Britain protest over drag queen children's event
"One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted."
The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster.
"No injuries have been reported and officers remain at the scene, the force said."
"The Tate was hosting Drag Queen Story Hour UK on Saturday, with tales told by Aida H Dee, who the gallery's website describes as ""the first drag artist in Europe to read stories to children in a nursery."""
"A rightwing group of protesters demonstrated outside the gallery and were met by counterprotesters led by trans-rights campaigners and political groups, including Stand Up to Racism."
Officers had to form a corridor so attenders could get into the venue.
"Writing on Twitter, the drag queen said the day had been ""proper emotional,"" adding that five protesters had gained entry to the Tate and ""caused a disruption"" in parts of the building, but they did not affect the readings."
"She had previously told Pink News that the invite to the Tate for the event during LGBTQ+ history month had been ""an honour."""
Her readings have previously been targeted by protesters.
"The Drag Queen had said that ""risk assessments"" had taken place beforehand - but added it was ""ridiculous"" that they were necessary."
"Aida tweeted: ""5 haters made it into the Tate. They caused a disruption. BUT not to Drag Story Hour UK ...They made a fuss elsewhere in the building, not where the show was!! SHOW 2 went swimmingly!!!"""
"Aida had been staging three storytelling sessions on Saturday at 11am, noon and 2pm."
"A spokesperson for the Tate said: ""We do not programme artists in order to promote particular points of view, nor to reconcile differing points of view."""
"Our galleries offer a broad programme and visitors have the freedom to choose which aspects of it they engage with."""
Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report
"Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on ""lender watch"" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday."
"The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported."
"Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage."
"Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015."
"The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city."
"Not only was his claim insensitive, it was also a lie."
Another nearby skyscraper on Pine Street in Lower Manhattan became the tallest building after the destruction of the Twin Towers.
"High-rise office leasing in Manhattan has been dropping for years, which was exacerbated after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies shut down and employees of surviving firms worked remotely."
"Wells Fargo, which is servicing the mortgage on 40 Wall Street, ""has reached out to the borrower for a status of leasing developments"" and the plans to improve the property's performance, according to the filing, Bloomberg reported."
Wagner owner says war in Ukraine will drag on for years
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years.
Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas.
He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.
"The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed ""Putin's chef"" for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24."
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south.
"The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the ""special military operation"" will continue until its goals are fulfilled."
The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.
He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance.
"As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter."
"On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure."
"High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas."
"Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was ""difficult but controllable,"" adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas."
"Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones."
The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday.
The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening.
"Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region."
"The grainy video showed a fast-moving object approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast."
The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified.
"The Ukrainian military hasn't commented on the attack, and Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration, wouldn't confirm the drone attack when he spoke in televised remarks on Saturday."
"The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies."

'Yellowstone' actor Q'orianka Kilcher beats fraud charges
"Attorney Camille Vasquez, who represented Johnny Depp in last year's blockbuster defamation trial, has scored another legal victory - this time with ""Yellowstone"" actor Q'orianka Kilcher."
"On Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office cleared Kilcher, 32, of all charges in a workers"" compensation fraud case."

Balenciaga boss calls holiday campaign 'stupid mistake'
Luxury clothing brand Balenciaga is still reeling from the backlash over two of its recent ad campaigns.
"Months after the fashion house came under heat for promotional images that critics said sexualized children, Balenciaga artistic director Demna (full name Demna Gvasalia) said he's still sorry for the images in an interview with Vogue published Friday."
"""I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility,"" he told Vogue, echoing a previous statement he posted to social media in December."
"In November, the brand shared photos for its ""The Gift"" collection, which featured child models posing with teddy bears that were dressed in bondage attire."
"Shortly after, Balenciaga dropped photos for its spring 2023 campaign that featured a page from a 2008 Supreme Court case involving ""virtual child pornography"" in the background."
"Parents, including reality TV star and longtime Balenciaga fan - and brand partner - Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the brand and its ""disturbing images"" on social media."
"Days later, Balenciaga released a statement apologizing for the photos and outlining the changes it would implement to avoid similar ""mistakes"" in the future."
"""This experience has forced me to reevaluate a lot of things in the way I, we, work, in the way we create and communicate images, the way we interact with our audiences, and the way we learn from our mistakes and move forward,"" Demna told Vogue."
"He detailed the postbacklash changes at Balenciaga: ""restructuring the image department,"" conducting more internal and external checks for campaign imagery, and partnering with the National Children's Alliance to help ""thousands of kids in the process of overcoming trauma and dealing with their mental health."""
"""It's the one thing that makes me happy about this whole horrible situation: to do something good out of it,"" he said of that partnership, which was announced Wednesday."
"Also teaming up with the NCA is Balenciaga's parent company, Kering, which oversees other luxury brands including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta."
"Under the Kering umbrella is Gucci, which faced backlash in December for a campaign featuring Harry Styles that some social media critics alleged also sexualized children."
"In the interview, Denma said he plans to move away from the brand's ""provocative"" ways."
"""This is part of my learning: I will have a more mature and serious approach to everything I release as an idea or an image,"" he said."
"""I have decided to go back to my roots in fashion as well as to the roots of Balenciaga, which is making quality clothes - not making image or buzz."""
"Speaking of the brand's origins, elsewhere in the interview Demna said one of the most ""painful"" parts of the backlash was tarnishing ""the name of Balenciaga and the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga."""
"""Balenciaga is a house that is over one century old and is based on strong and beautiful creative values, and I have been busy doing all in my creative power to bring it to its modern relevance, and suddenly we were under attack and labeled as something we're not at all,"" Demna said."
"""We certainly made a huge and stupid mistake with the gifting campaign, and we certainly have learned from it."""
"It's Fake News, CBN Debunks Claim It Lacks Capacity To Print More New Naira Notes"
"The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as misleading, the report that claimed to be quoting CBN govemor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, as attributing the current challenge in the distribution of the newly redesigned Naira banknotes to a shortage of printing materials at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Plc."
"In a statement issued on Saturday, CBN spokesman, Osita Nwasinobi, said at no time did the CBN governor made such statement during his presentation to the National Council of State at its meeting on Friday, February 10, 2023."
Mr Nwasinobi said Emefiele only told the meeting that the NSPMC was working on printing all denominations of the Naira to meet the transaction needs of Nigerians.
"He said while the CBN appreciates the concerns shown by all stakeholders about the distribution of the new Naira notes, ""we are alarmed at the extent to which vested interests are attempting to manipulate facts and pitch the public against the Bank."""
"Nwasinobi said the CBN remains committed to performing its monetary policy functions, as stipulated in the CBN Act, 2007 (as amended)."
"""We also wish to restate that the NSPMC has the capacity and enough materials to produce the required indent of the Naira."
"""The bank, therefore, wishes to appeal to the public to disregard the said report and exercise more restraint, even as we work assiduously to increase the circulation of the new notes in the country,"" he added."
"On a particular voice note trending on the social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geopolitical region of the country, the CBN said there was no such plan and that the claims were illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system."
"""The public is therefore advised to ignore such recordings as they do not represent the policy thrust of the CBN and are only the desperate attempts of persons bent on inciting the public against the Bank,"" he stated."
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut
Porro had an afternoon to forget against Leicester (Picture: Getty)
"Tim Sherwood tore into Pedro Porro's ""absolutely disgusting"" defending during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat to Leicester City."
Spurs signed the right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39million.
The 23-year-old was handed his debut by Antonio Conte on Saturday at the King Power Stadium with his side taking the lead after 14 minutes through Rodrigo Bentancur.
"But it turned into an miserable afternoon with Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho all scoring to give Leicester a 3-1 at half-time with Porro enduring a torrid first-half in the Premier League."
"The Spaniard was at fault again as Leicester thought they had added a fourth through Barnes and while the goal was ruled out for offside, former Spurs manager Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back's defensive efforts."
"""I don't want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties,"" Sherwood told Soccer Saturday."
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is no bad it is unbelievable.
"His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left hand side."
"Daniel Levy was saying this week, they have spent a lot of money, yes they have, but their recruitment has been very poor and this is the latest addition."
Let's not make any conclusions at the moment but what I am looking at is a player who does not want to defend.
More: Premier League
"""Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing."""
"While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time."
"Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place."

Jack Smith should win any privilege fight over Mike Pence subpoena
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe?
The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail.
"First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege."
Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.
"The Supreme Court declined to take up Trump's appeal last year, with only Justice Clarence Thomas (husband of 2020 election denier Ginni Thomas) dissenting."
"But the court left open the question of whether an ex-president can claim privilege, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting he'd support such a claim."
"So it's at least unclear whether a former president can claim the privilege, saying nothing of whether the claim would succeed."
"Plus, the Supreme Court appeal over then-President Richard Nixon's attempt to avoid subpoena compliance shows that a vague privilege assertion won't do, and can be overcome by a specific need for evidence."
"The court observed in 1974""s United States v. Nixon:"
"... when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice."
"The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial."
"Therefore, precedent is on the government's side."
"Of course, however, delays from litigating even a losing issue can be a victory of sorts for Trump."
But further dampening the odds of a successful privilege claim is the previous rejection of Trump's attempt to block Jan. 6 grand jury testimony.
"As The Washington Post reported in October, that rejection noted that former Pence aide Marc Short, for example, ""probably possessed information important to the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that was not available from other sources."""
"That Pence, too, likely has unique information would help the DOJ in any subpoena fight."
And the reason we think Pence has such information is yet another reason that a privilege claim should fail.
That's because Pence has chosen to write publicly about at least some of his supposed conversations with Trump in connection with Jan. 6.
It's hard to say communications are privileged when you've previously deemed them fit to publicize.
"So while the subpoena might present varying political and personal calculations for Pence - who may vie for the 2024 Republican nomination against Trump, someone who effectively condoned calls for Pence's extrajudicial execution on Jan. 6 - the courts should have an easy time siding with DOJ on privilege."
The Case Against a Biden Run Is Obvious - and Weak
Why is this important?
"While Biden and his fellow Democrats can't do much in the way of passing laws with the GOP in control of the House, they can still spend the next two years setting an example."
"Collectively, everyone on the team should be seeking out opportunities to play Gallant to the Republicans"" weird Goofus impulses."
But it's also important for Biden to burnish his credibility with the American people - and maybe be a direly needed change agent in our all-too-tatty political culture.
"Washington, a notoriously cynical place, is famous for its common sense-crippling ideas about leadership."
Perhaps one of the most notorious is the odd standard that holds that publicly admitting errors is a sign of weakness and that politicians should go to comical lengths to avoid doing so.
"There's another way: In Bailout, Neil Barofsky's memoir of his time in Washington serving as the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he described the advice he received from Kristine Belisle, the woman he smartly hired to be his communications director."
"It was about as anti-Washington as it can get: ""We'll admit and even highlight our mistakes."""
"As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness:"
This is the best way to earn the press's trust.
They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else.
SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP.
"We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty."
"No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked."
"No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth."
This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical.
"Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents."
The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Some Super Bowl Commercials I Can't Wait to See
A nineties sitcom star reprising his beloved role to sell you car insurance.
"An ad that becomes a cultural phenomenon and gets immediately green-lighted as a TV show, extending a twelve-second scene into ten seasons."
All the celebrities from last year's crypto ads apologizing for their crypto ads.
"Those ""whassup"" guys but the bit is that now they're old."
"Everybody's into whodunnits now, right?"
So some series of ads directed by Rian Johnson where if you figure out who did the murder you get a discount on a year of car insurance.
A commercial that all of the super-online conservative guys are going to be furious about for a week.
Timothée Chalamet in some capacity.
Somebody who was supposedly cancelled forever making his triumphant return to television to sell you beer.
An ad for the worst movie you'll ever see that you'll definitely watch when it's streaming in three weeks.
An excruciatingly catchy new jingle that you'll be singing to yourself for years.
A recycled Twitter joke from two months ago.
A musician whose whole thing is being counterculture who is counterculturally telling you to bank with Wells Fargo.
"The ""zoom zoom"" kid but the bit is that now he's an adult."
Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'
"Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sat down with Breitbart News on Thursday and discussed his plans to block the ATF pistol brace rule and his conviction that the Biden Department of Justice ""doesn't want an armed citizenry"" in the first place."
Clyde made clear his opposition to the pistol brace rule.
His reasons for that opposition include both general objections and more specific ones.
"Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature."
"He said, ""The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, not to make the law. When you have the executive branch making the law and enforcing the law, then you have have a king, and a kingdom. Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States."""
Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms.
"He noted, ""What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration. And confiscation, in my opinion, is the ultimate goal, because this Justice Department doesn't want an armed citizenry."""
"He added, ""But this Justice Department wants a registered citizenry, so they know who's got what, so they can come after us."""
"Clyde's contention is that the ATF pistol brace rule was born in this environment of hostility toward the Second Amendment and toward private gun ownership, and he plans to fight it tooth and nail."
"He said he has ""three tools"" with which to fight the rule."
The first of those tools is the SHORT Act and the second is the Congressional Review Act.
"On January 30 Breitbart News quoted Clyde outlining his plan to ""reintroduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces."""
"He also noted that he would ""introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, to override the Biden administration's unlawful overreach."""
"Both acts, the SHORT Act and the Congressional Review Act, have the possibility of blocking the ATF pistol brace rule."
"But as Clyde told Breitbart News Thursday, the great challenge is that both of those routes will ultimately require President Biden's signature, either to enact the SHORT Act legislation or to finalize a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act."
"He made clear that getting Biden's signature is not an impossibility, as there are ways; for instance, the SHORT Act legislation could be added to other, larger bills that Democrats are very anxious to pass."
"However, Clyde indicated there is also a third way to block the ATF pistol brace rule."
"He said: ""I'm on the Appropriations Committee and we can defund this pistol brace rule, through what is called a limitation amendment. We can literally defund this rule and basically say, ""No money may be spent executing or enforcing this particular pistol brace rule."""
"And we can also do the very same thing with the ATF receiver/frame rule, from last August."
I think both of them need to be defunded and I look forward to working with our appropriators to do it.

"'We Hope' Biden Has a Plan for Handling Title 42 Ending, 'If They Do, They Haven't Shared It Fully'"
"On Friday's edition of NBC's ""MTP Now,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said that he has ""a lot of concern"" over what will happen when Title 42 ends in May, he hopes the Biden administration has a plan for when the policy ends, and that ""If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet."""
"And said that ""we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us."""
"Polis stated that he wishes that more time was spent on the issue of immigration during the meeting of governors at the White House, but the issue ""came up."""
We did have Secretary Mayorkas there for part of it.
"And so, we brought up, again, there's a lot of concern I share about what will happen when Title 42 ends in May and so, making sure that the federal government has a plan."
We hope they do.
"If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet."
"But we've said, you need a plan."
We want them to vet it with us.
"We want to make sure it's not what we experienced in December times five or times three, that would be a disaster for the country and it would be terrible for the Biden administration."

"McDonald's withdraws ""tasteless"" advert near crematorium - RT World News"
"McDonald's has apologized after an advertisement for the fast-food chain's ""McCrispy"" burger was placed close to a crematorium in the UK - although some locals did see the funny side."
The restaurant chain has pledged to remove the offending advertising hoarding following complaints from residents of Truro in the UK county of Cornwall.
It had gained attention on social media on Friday for being placed on a busy road directly opposite an establishment which offers cremation services.
"The brightly lit advert, which was placed directly behind a sign pointing to the crematorium, was branded as ""tasteless"" by some angry locals."
"""Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one,"" said a resident whose mother-in-law was cremated at the funeral home last year, as quoted by British media."
"However, not everyone was quite so offended by the unfortunate placement of the advertisement, with one noting that a person's reaction to it would likely be influenced by ""how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie."""
"One person said they ""fell off the chair laughing"" when they spotted the advert online, while it was also noted by another local that it was ""no worse"" than the council's decision to entertain the idea of allowing a crematorium to be built ""next door to a retirement village."""
"A statement issued by McDonald's was published by local media on Friday soon after an image of the advertisement went viral online, in which the restaurant chain said it would remove the advert as soon as possible."
"""We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed,"" the fast-food brand said."
"Cornwall Council, which operates both the crematorium and the bus shelter which displays the advert, declined the comment on the furor when contacted by local media."
'Gut instinct' missing woman is not in river
"Searches for missing English woman Nicola Bulley have entered a 16th day after her partner said his ""gut instinct"" is that she is not in the river."
"Lancashire Police said officers are keeping an ""open mind"" while continuing to appeal for information about Ms Bulley, who disappeared on 27 January while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre."
"The force is continuing to search the River Wyre towards the sea at Morecambe Bay, working on one hypothesis that the 45-year-old, from Inskip, could have fallen in."
"Their search has been aided by specialists and divers from HM Coastguard, mountain rescue, and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, with sniffer dogs, drones, and police helicopters deployed."
"Ms Bulley vanished while walking her springer spaniel Willow near the river, shortly after dropping her daughters, aged six and nine, at school."
"The mortgage adviser's phone was found on a bench overlooking the river, still connected to a work call."
"Her partner, Paul Ansell said he wants to keep ""all options open"" about her disappearance, but his ""gut instinct"" tells him she is not in the river."
"He described Ms Bulley as ""fun,"" ""loving,"" ""the most loyal friend you could ever have"" and an ""exceptional mum"" who ""absolutely adores our girls."""
"""She's just a pillar of strength to our family and without her, the hole is bigger than you can possibly imagine,"" he told 5 News."
"Mr Ansell said that although the family is going through ""unprecedented hell,"" hope that his partner will be found is ""stronger than ever."""
Police have discounted foul play and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry.
"On Thursday, the focus of their search switched from St Michael's to around 10 miles downstream where the river empties into the sea at Morecambe Bay, with patrol and rescue boats spotted in the area."
East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95
"BERLIN (AP) - Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died."
He was 95.
"Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted."
"Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification."
"""The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his,"" the Left wrote on Twitter.""That will remain his political legacy."""
"During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure."
He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
"A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 - days after the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure."
But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own.
"The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest."
"Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification."
"In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual ""united fatherland"" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin."
"Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support."
The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl.
"Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS - the predecessor of today's opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament."
Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.
"In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden."
It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine.
Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans.
His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.
"Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party."
"""Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist,"" tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group."
"""Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."""
Indian govt withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day after criticism
Hugging a cow on Valentine's Day is no longer being encouraged by the Indian government - despite it previously asking people to do so to promote Hindu values.
"The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) retracted its ""Cow Hug Day"" appeal after it attracted criticism from political rivals and social media users."
The Indian government department had called on citizens to deviate from Western romantic gestures celebrated on Valentine's Day.
"Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been ""absolutely crazy, defying logic."""
"He added that the decision to withdraw the appeal was more ""to prevent the politics of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters."""
"The AWBI reneged on its appeal on Friday saying it ""stands withdrawn."""
"It was only on Wednesday when its statement read that ""hugging cows [would] bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness."""
More on India
"It added that the cow is the ""backbone of Indian culture and rural economy... because of its nourishing nature like [a] mother."""
There were mixed reactions to the initial announcement as some posted videos of cows rejecting being hugged and charging off.
"Others wanted to clarify that the appeal was more for following one's own culture, as opposed to ""blindly"" following Western values."
"Young Indians typically spend Valentine's Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties."
"Cow cuddling is nothing new either - with it being considered therapeutic in parts of the world, and in The Netherlands where it is known as ""koe knuffelen."""
"Devout Hindus worship the cow - known as gau mata, or ""mother cow"" - and most states in India have banned cow slaughter."
"In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity."
Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity.
"Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity."
"While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest."
Pedestrian dies in hospital after crash with car in Cowdenbeath as man arrested
A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife.
The 38-year-old female was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the crash on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1.30pm.
A 24-year-old man has subsequently been arrested in connection with the crash.
Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward.
"Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: ""Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and who witnessed the crash to get in touch."""
I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us.
"""Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."""
IN NUMBERS: The Oslo boroughs where the most foreigners live
"Roughly 177,000 of Oslo's 634,000's residents have immigrated to Norway from other countries."
"When you include those born in Oslo to foreign parents, the proportion of those who are immigrants or have an immigrant background rises to more than a third."
"In Oslo, citizens from Asia, including Turkey, made up the largest immigrant group, with over 62,985 of these nationals living in the city, according to figures from the national data agency Statistics Norway (SSB)."
"After that, citizens from the EU, EEA and the UK made up the second largest group, accounting for not far off 10 percent of the city's population."
"Africans made up the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo."
"Europeans from countries that aren't part of the UK, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 Oslo residents."
"From here, the size of the groups drops significantly."
"For example, there were just shy of 7,000 citizens from South American countries in 2022, while there was a smidge over 3,000 nationals hailing from North and Central America."
"Meanwhile, there were less than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo."
"Alna, in the northeast of the city, was the borough with the most foreign residents."
"Some 18,257 foreign residents were registered as living there in 2022."
"Afterwards, trendy Grünerløkka, located reasonably centrally, had the second highest number of foreign residents, with 17,631."
"Gamle Oslo also had a significant immigrant population, with 17,631 people living there after moving from another country."
"Statistics Norway's figures showed that foreigners were scattered all over the city's districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the borough furthest south in Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there."
"Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth most foreigners."
"After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country."
"At the other end of the spectrum, just 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central borough."
"Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand made up the other boroughs with the fewest foreign residents."
"However, these boroughs had significantly more immigrants living there than in central Oslo and Marka."
"Those from EU and EEA countries and those from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen."
"Meanwhile, while plenty of citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also resided in Game Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as living in the boroughs of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand."
"Gamle Oslo and Alna were the two parts of the city where the largest number of immigrants from Africa lived, along with Stovner, Grünerløkka and Søndre Norstrand."
"Those from North America were spread fairly evenly across Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, Vestre Aker and Nordre Aker."
"Citizens from South and Central America were most commonly found in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo St.Hanshaugen and Sagene."
"Europeans from outside the EU, EEA and UK tended to live in the town's most central borough, Ullern, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker and Stovner."
"And finally, of the several hundred nationals from Oceania, Frogner, Grünerløkka and Gamle Oslo were the boroughs with the highest populations of these nationals."
Zimbabwe to Start Operating New Coal Power Unit by March
By Florence Tan
"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will start operating a new unit at its only coal-fired power plant by March, says the country's deputy energy minister, providing relief to millions of citizens rocked by frequent power outages in recent months."
The new unit of the Hwange power plant will lift the African nation's installed capacity by more than 14% to 2400 megawatts.
"The next unit is expected to be commissioned soon after, Magna Mudyiwa said, without giving a timeline."
"Less than half of Zimbabwe's 16 million citizens have access to electricity, and a global squeeze on funding new coal-fired capacity has limited the country's ability to plug chronic power cuts that have lasted as long as 18 hours in recent days."
"""We have the capacity to generate up to 2100 megawatts (MW) from our power sources but at the moment we're generating far less than that..about 1000MW,"" Mudyiwa told Reuters."
"""But our demand for electricity is about 1700MW so we have a serious deficit,"" she said."
"Deficient rainfall has led to a decline in hydropower generation, while the efficiency of the sole, decades-old coal-fired utility has dipped sharply over time while power demand has surged in recent years due to higher mining and agricultural activity."
The International Monetary Fund counts electricity shortages as one of the major factors weighing on Zimbabwe's growth prospects.
Lack of funding for coal-fired power is driving the mining and agriculture-dependent economy to import costly power from regional neighbors including Zambia and Mozambique.

"(PERSON11) But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, so, something is wrongly –"
"Basically, the big trade, or something is wrong."
"So, some files are still – still have weird output."
"But – but for most folders, it should be already fine."
"(PERSON1) Okay, thanks."
"(PERSON6) Yeah, that's great."
"I support this, it's great that, [PERSON7], you have thought of [PERSON11]."
And [PERSON11] now has the time.
"There are other things where I was thinking of [PERSON11] and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening."
"So, if you, [PERSON11], had the time."
"Obviously, there is no way we could do it for next week."
But we should really have the system – ready for –
I looked at the tutorial from the NLP – was it?
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo.
They do offline subtitling.
"So, that's slightly easier than what we do."
They still have the same segmentation issues and so on.
But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening.
"And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired."
"So, there is like a natural shortening in the data."
It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening.
We would put it in the architecture.
"(PERSON8) That takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is getting passes."
"So, once I know that, I can keep a track of it, so, for the future –"
"Or actually, for future I would not need it, because once I have the web file, I probably won't need to do a convert."
"(PERSON6) Well, this, this should actually be –"
Can you still hear me?
The sound quality is a little worse.
"So, this should really be done, all the time."
"So, every time we run this evaluation, it should be run from scratch."
"So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation."
"(PERSON8) But still, if I am keeping track of the files that need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of the known ones at least, and of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later."
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago.
"Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set."
"And every time, you all..."
"It is not just you personally, [PERSON8]."
"There were other things, obviously."
"But every time you thought about that, you thought ""this will be easy, we will just run it""."
"And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems."
"So, this is known, common."
It is always like that.
So that's a message for everybody.
"Before you try, you never know what the problem will be."
"So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video."
Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording.
"So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not."
And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats.
"So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers."
"So, do you have any word error rates so far?"
"(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it."
"So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together."
"And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary."
"So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times."
"And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that."
"So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM."
This will not be so frequent.
"But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this ""alzo"", if you remember, if he says this ""alzo"" with a ""Z"" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the ""Z""."
"And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data."
"So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2]."
"Maybe you continue on the call, right?"
"I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on."
But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary.
"So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting."
Share your screen and show it.
"And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file."
One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute.
But all these words should be known words.
"So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model."
And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied.
"So, the dictionary will have three col ns."
"The grapheme, as it is output."
One recognized.
"The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed."
And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations.
"And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form."
So that is when the language model sees.
"And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it."
And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries.
"So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together."
So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary.
"And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together."
"Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary."
(PERSON4) Okay.
"(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does this make sense?"
"(PERSON2) Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it."
"(PERSON6) Yeah, so is there anything else, [PERSON2], that you have?"
"(PERSON2) Well, maybe interesting information for Dominik."
I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for time stamping.
I'm not sure how good it will be because I'm trying to do it on (Libry) Speech.
"And, though, when I was downloading it, they claimed it had more than 600 hours."
But then the training said that the actual training set contained only around 300 hours.
And I'm still not sure whether these 300 hours do not contain similar sentences.
Or actually the same sentences but spoken by different speakers.
"For example, in English or Czech I used to observe steeper conversions."
And now it won't convert so fast.
"So, if we take some samples during the training."
Then there are still some serious errors in the ASR output.
"So, I'm hopeful that for the time stamping, it is good enough."
Or at least we might try it.
"(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah."
"So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated."
"And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call."
"So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so."
"And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself."
"So, I call it ""do-it-yourself integration""."
"So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else."
"So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself."
"So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded."
"So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done."
"[PERSON4], right?"
"The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs?"
I think it was.
"(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think."
"So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines."
"And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever."
Simply play them.
Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works.
Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear.
"It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline."
"And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here, in this case [PERSON4], it would be most efficient for all of us."
"So, [PERSON8], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration."
"(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English."
"So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution."
"The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers."
"So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved."
"Ah, so that's one particle experiment."
"And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing."
"So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment."
One problem is the implicit language model.
"So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences."
"And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better."
"And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea."
It was during the training.
They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound.
"So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system."
(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing.
"Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document."
It is highlighted four times.
"So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session."
"And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat."
And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible.
"So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced."
"So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files."
"And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster."
"Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it."
So there this skill is something that that we need people to have.
And we need someone to be responsible for that.
And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8].
"If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so."
And then we need -
"So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems."
"So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR."
"So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday."
"[PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up."
"So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5]."
If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the -
"It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right."
"So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works."
At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR.
"So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure."
"So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time."
"End-to-end ASR, which is better in general."
"And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords."
"And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms."
So that's my suggestion of what we could do.
And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that.
"So, we have discussed this with [PERSON14]."
"And, [PERSON14], is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?"
"(PERSON17) Yeah, so if there is anyone else who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch."
"So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet."
And that's the most urgent problem these days.
"So, we really could make an impact there."
"(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -"
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like -
"We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5]."
And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.
"So, I plan to do it myself."
"I plan to go there, but we need a backup person."
"And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording,"
"So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again."
And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing.
And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow.
"I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign."
It may be difficult to prepare these tables.
"So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call."
"To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution."
Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free.
If that would help us or not.
"Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7]."
"So, simple html is probably the way to go."
"So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up."
"So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner."
Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage.
Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html.
"So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that."
"So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15]."
We know they have like -
"The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m."
They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101].
This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.
"(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that."
"(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks."
"I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken."
"And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions."
(PERSON11) <parallel_talk> For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric -
"Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. </parallel_talk>"
"So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation."
"So <parallel_talk> have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output </parallel_talk>, right?"
<parallel_talk> And then rare words evaluation.
"And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate </parallel_talk> but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right?"
"Yes, so I totally agree."
This involves also manual preparation of the reference.
"So, <parallel_talk> both need manually created references. </parallel_talk>"
I have one remark from [PERSON1].
So <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary.
And she should share it soon. </parallel_talk>
"So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word -"
So <parallel_talk> this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. </parallel_talk>
So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously.
"And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the <unintelligible/> domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs."
"So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the <unintelligible/> domain."
Could you do that?
"(PERSON11) It should be doable, so let's give it a try."
It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that.
"So, I'll write it down."
"So, <parallel_talk> aiming towards [ORGANISATION62] deadline with subtitler study paper. </parallel_talk>"
Yes <parallel_talk> and then then a multi-source with [PERSON7] or based upon [PERSON7] or - </parallel_talk>
"And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID?"
How do we plug that in?
"(PERSON13) It will be audio to text worker, and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class."
"<unintelligible/> silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline."
(PERSON11) That is important.
"Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2]."
"And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5]."
"If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/>"
"We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/>"
"And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet."
"That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR."
"So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language."
I just made it up this type of setup.
Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker.
"This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language."
That's also an option.
"So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes."
"So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines."
"Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual."
If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English.
"Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning."
"All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages."
"And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed."
"(PERSON3) The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output."
That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis.
"But I'm not sure it might give us the same answers, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint."
"(PERSON4) I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything, and it looks at the constraints, and when it translates the constraints, it looks like the constraints given, and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors, but it in fact does not do any in that sense."
It makes some general translation errors but not the (phenomena) we are trying to solve.
"Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different."
"Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?"
"(PERSON4) Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and in most cases they are."
Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct contexts.
"(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong."
"And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases."
"(PERSON3) But you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right?"
You do not do any-
(PERSON3) -lemmatization of the reference and the-
"(PERSON4) Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma."
"(PERSON3) Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right?"
(PERSON4) It is just the dilemma score for the (European?) is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so <unintelligible/>
Coverage is always like 97 percent.
"It just generates the correct lemmas, just-"
"(PERSON3) Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it."
"So basically, the lemma coverage says whether the constraint is there, and the surface coverage difference suggests that it might be incorrectly inflected, but that is not the case."
"(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1],"
"but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually,"
"but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah."
"So, I was thinking there might be."
"But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer?"
"As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs."
"But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario."
"I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?"
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
"(PERSON1) By style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?"
"(PERSON3) Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task."
"But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena."
I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover.
And the idea is that the style of the sentences gets quite vaguely defined.
"So again, not so sure."
(PERSON1) We have this corpus of sentence transformations.
"And one thing that is there and could be labelled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general."
"So, details are omitted, the sentence is simplified, and then making the sentence sound colloquial."
"Well, just a paraphrase."
And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening of the sentence.
"For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with English–Czech, but we do not have any reference data there."
"So, we do not have any sentence compression dataset."
"So maybe the generalization could be of interest but I'm afraid that there are too many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization."
"And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for example, this could be done <unintelligible/> for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset."
"So, there will be a root-based generation of some sentence counterpart."
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.
(PERSON1) That is actually a very good idea.
"So, we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of [PROJECT1] test set that would cover that."
Ah so that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so if you are...  maybe I'll share the screen and browse that.
(PERSON8) Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's... I don't know how many BLEU points lower.
"(PERSON2) Because like the way I believe Martin does his <unintelligible/> little translation, so he translates more sentences at once and then picks only the centre one and goes like this for the whole document."
"So, the context is like in one <unintelligible/> together with sentence we actually want to translate."
"(PERSON10) Yeah, I think - wasn't it Dominik doing some experiments with Ivana?"
I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they were attending the context or concatenating the context with input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation.
But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting-
"(PERSON1) Like everybody is different, it's definitely a different calculation, different leader, but it's I'm surprised that [PERSON8] says that it doesn't work full stop."
"(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it <laugh/>"
"(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding."
"So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence,"
"maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know."
"Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets."
"(PERSON2) Yeah, so just know like-"
"(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what-"
when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments.
"The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now,"
"I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also,"
I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position.
"I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders."
(PERSON8) And it was probably due to low scores.
"(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> that you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase-based output and the attention is like double diagonal, so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's surprising that it didn't work."
"(PERSON10) So, if you if you input the phrase-based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase-based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, right?"
"(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> that you like fully to rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task."
"(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right?"
You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything?
And hope that the system learns it?
"(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens."
"So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once."
I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear.
"So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree."
(PERSON2) But the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do.
Because I have no experience and no time to get it running.
(PERSON1) I thought it meant something using I don't know mediator.
"(PERSON2) No, make a HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue."
And send the text back in a HTTP request.
Because my idea is that the user clicks be used in the Ukrainian project too.
"(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time."
Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds.
And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR).
"And the model will do some logic, some inference with that."
"And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back."
And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.
(PERSON1) I could think about that.
"Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that."
(PERSON2) Oh maybe a different HTTP server.
"I don't know, maybe we don't even need a fancy HTTP server for that."
"(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this."
"(PERSON2) Yeah, the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time."
(PERSON1) Well I think online text flow is something around 2 000 at least.
"(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have <unintelligible/> let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a <unintelligible/> side worker, so <unintelligible/> that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers."
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.
"(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly."
"(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks."
"So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders."
"We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set,"
Who do we have here?
"Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately."
"So, this would be for [PERSON2],"
"Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this."
"Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon."
"(PERSON7) Okay, thank you."
"We have [PERSON5], that's good."
"So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important."
"Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?"
"(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment."
"(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing,"
Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup.
I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs.
"So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,"
"(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation."
And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more.
"So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon."
"So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason,"
"Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones,"
"and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on."
"So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both,"
"but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices."
"First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations."
"(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same."
"(PERSON2) Yes, that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints."
With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding.
Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams.
And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff.
"But for the positive constraints, I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff."
Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.
"(PERSON7) Okay, so back to the positive constraints."
Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?
"(PERSON2) Yeah, right now, I'm kind of waiting for the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9])."
"Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code), and I think I know why it's so slow."
"Because for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing, you open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it."
But you only you do that -
"(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains."
"And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it."
"And <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party."
And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it.
"So, there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/>"
He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>
"(PERSON7) Well, okay."
"So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail."
"(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance."
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
"(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?"
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?
(PERSON3) Several years ago.
MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML.
That was in the first year when that happened.
"And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers."
"And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon."
The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue.
"So, we have, even as I said, your system, your tool is interesting."
Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people.
But your paper is too bad.
"You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML."
"(PERSON4) Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial."
Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.
"(PERSON3) That's yes, that is... like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues."
They have final paper registration in July.
"So, the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May."
"Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper."
So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings.
And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings.
And the authors would be free to choose.
So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech.
"If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline."
"So, there is an absolute strict requirement."
And I think it's they cannot have anything against it.
Because if the paper is worth publishing.
"Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event."
"So yeah, I think it's okay."
"So, we do not need to ask for a special session."
"In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that."
In Interspeech we want the satellite event.
But we will tell our people.
"If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech."
"Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline."
And that is for PBML.
"(PERSON7) Ah, okay."
But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event.
"Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings."
"(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject."
"But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses."
Like to fail because you are unable to finish it.
"Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass."
"I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work."
"(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one."
"Just within the second deadline, you should submit it."
That's pretty much the only thing he asked.
"But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that."
They find it easier to read for the exam.
"No, sorry, study for the exam-"
"(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy."
"(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun."
"(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me."
"(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation."
"So, it tries to use a different wording."
"To, for example, specify the thing."
"So actually, I really liked it."
"I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction."
"And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important."
"If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good."
"Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless."
"But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff."
"So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information."
"And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples?"
"Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity."
"(PERSON2) Oh definitely, I can dump you my logs."
(PERSON7) But in which languages?
Because you know I don't speak German.
(PERSON2) English and German.
"(PERSON7) Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German <laugh/>."
(PERSON2) Then I can provide English–Chinese and English–Japanese if it helps <laugh/>.
"(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable."
"Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information."
"Sorry, I never thought about it in depth."
"But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag."
"So, I put a word into a bag."
And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word.
And I think that that's the problem with the flicker.
"If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain."
And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not.
So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition.
"Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have."
Even though you cannot promise it's good.
But I think that we cannot work with this extra information.
And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it.
"If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself."
"And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly."
"And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created."
"Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us."
"So, I think that it's not good to show extra."
"Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality."
I think that's still better than showing the flicker.
Because what would be the real use case?
"Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really?"
Like from a user perspective?
"(PERSON1) Like technically, when human translators start translating, I mean the goal even there is for annotators, they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker."
"So, there are times when they would say something, and that would be wrong, so they would just correct themselves."
"(PERSON2) Well but yeah this means with my solution, like you would not do flicker, but you committed, like there is no way to change, but you correct yourself."
And that's actually what the translators are doing.
"(PERSON3) I'm strongly feeling that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy."
Because there is no concept of speech here.
We are directly working on text.
"But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us."
"And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us."
"It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community."
We can motivate participants to submit.
"Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive."
"So, in archives, people can publish any time, right?"
So that is not a benefit to their profiles.
So how to motivate participants to join our shared task.
"So, this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session."
"But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time, the time periods between proposals, submission and final paper submission was five months, so it would have been enough time for our schedule, but this time."
It is only three months.
"So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set."
"So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to."
"But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us."
It is more important to use it as a test session.
"So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there."
"And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program."
"so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important."
"So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there."
"(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth."
"(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing."
The test session is less of an urge.
"And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible."
I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that.
"So, we really need to practice these preparations."
"With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done."
But that is not the case.
It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected.
"So, we need to be there earlier."
"And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine."
"Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people."
"So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little."
Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions.
"I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document."
Maybe I forgot to tell all of you.
I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020.
And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions.
"So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions."
"And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording."
And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever.
Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording.
And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex.
"Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link."
"I have sent it by email, I remember."
2 bad lemons in a row :(
I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us.
This season I bought the next size I needed.
One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama.
I returned it and the company sent me a new one.
"The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off!"
I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.
Just as described
This is a basic puffer coat.
"If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations."
"The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit."
I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me.
"I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed."
"However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine."
There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later.
"The hood functions, but no ties on it."
The front zipper works.
"There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room."
There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you).
There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT.
"For the price, I think it is fine."
"I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold."
"I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign."
"However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent)."
"Overall, I am pleased."
The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.
This is a very nice skirt.
The lacy pattern is classy and soft
This is a very nice skirt.
The lacy pattern is classy and soft.
"It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool."
"This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into."
I think this could be flattering on anyone.
"I'm 5'5"" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down."
Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
"Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed."
"However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car."
The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob.
"This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it."
"There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle."
Good Price for Replacement
The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement.
"I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect!"
I own a 2013 Corolla LE.
I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy.
It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes.
"I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable."
Needs improvement
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement
Musical Start
The piano is great starters!
It finds your child’s inner artistic ability and musical talent.
It develops a good hand-eye coordination.
"The piano isn’t only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age."
"If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out!"
Very worth the money!
I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes.
The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw.
I was pretty taken aback.
I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago.
"Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week."
My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
Someone screwed up the formula??
This is so weird.
In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same!
I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera.
Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this.
"Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange."
No point in calling them red or pink.
The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped.
The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off.
I just wits there were a pink.
I guess the purple will suffice.
works for the most part
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago.
I then went and had highlights put in all over my head.
A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out.
"I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye."
"However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair."
"Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results."
My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was.
This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
don't believe the hype
Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments.
I tried reading it but I just found the language flat.
"the ""freshwater"" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived."
I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.
I give this book 10 stars!
Excellent read!!
I absolutely loved the book!!
I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves.
"Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down."
"Funny, witty and very entertaining!!"
Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
I really Like this ring light!
It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done!
"The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on."
"I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating."
Confusing storyline
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot.
Also the title doesn’t fit the story.
"The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened."
I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
Loved Collins...
It took a while to warm up to Grady
3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one.
"It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her."
"Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together."
"Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed."
"Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around."
"While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves."
"I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself?"
"To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms?"
Was he delusional?!
"Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc."
She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward.
"I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent."
"I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that."
"Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her?"
Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two.
"She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened."
"There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding."
"He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end."
"I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character."
"The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part?"
"I adored, hence my rating."
"If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did."
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill
"Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters."
It is very difficult to tell it is him.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
"Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done."
The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages...
The scenery and costumes were excellent.
Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position.
Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times
Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!
"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017."
"At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel."
I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel.
I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system.
March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect.
"Every time I try, I get the error message."
Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit.
I followed the YouTube setup video with no success.
"When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth)."
"Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone."
This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone!
I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection.
"Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication."
I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
"Good, but would like to find something better"
"After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago."
"It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay."
"However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex."
"I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly."
The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon.
"Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison."
"I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one."
"Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days."
My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.
Broke in less than a week
I like the product it’s a nice size and color!
Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece!
I’m really disappointed!
It’s all assembled and I don’t have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?!
My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn’t work either!
The door popped right out again!!
Not too easy to assemble plus....
"It’s a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult."
Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked.
I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together.
Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don’t match evenly.
This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line.
Still haven’t figured out to align them.
BAD CODE PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE POD
I purchased these in February.
Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine.
I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem.
"Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box."
I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each.
I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message.
I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine.
It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue.
Very disappointing since my return window has expired.
UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money.
Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
Sweetener on the go.
Such a convenience!
It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets!
"I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend’s house."
"While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea."
"Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!"
"Doesn't actually do any air ""cleaning"""
"Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something."
"As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size."
The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks.
"Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up."
"It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type)."
"It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled."
"However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great."
"I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly."
"My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here."
"As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier."
"tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier."
I guess it was easier to break than they thought.
I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside.
"Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back."
In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence.
I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance.
"With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do."
Easy to install?????
Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install.
"I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck."
I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells.
Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working.
After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase.
The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work.
It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly.
"It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want."
"One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is."
I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.
Lost package - Re-Charged me
"Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars."
They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time.
After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount.
"I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher."
I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars.
Whatever.
Works well after some headaches.
Had some problems getting it to work.
The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery.
When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC.
Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info.
PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case).
"The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth."
Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
... was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold
"I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker."
Nothing close!
The set looks VERY cheap.
"It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier."
"Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear."
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :(
This ring was beautiful.
I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable!
The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time.
"I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing."
"Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time."
This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry.
"I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me."
:( Too bad because I really did love it!
"So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!!"
You won't be disappointed!
buy the Pampered Chef...
"I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage."
I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies.
I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products.
Not this one.
At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working.
"I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat."
So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop.
It's totally worth it!
Will not buy Mr. Coffee again
"It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it."
"If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days."
Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe.
"I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house."
"It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price."
Must buy!!
I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great!
"The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain."
I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars!
"It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!"
"Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield."
Shame on Audubon.
"The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and ""Make sure it is securely in place."""
HOW???
"It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind."
"You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it."
It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug.
It is a complete PITA.
I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards.
"(Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually ""baffle"" squirrels!)"
I love many of the features of these lights
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window.
I love many of the features of these lights.
"Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow."
"The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants."
I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights.
"The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only."
"I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself."
I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants.
The lights are small!
"When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit."
BEWARE...SMELL IS VERY BAD...CARD SLOTS TOO BIG!
"When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD."
"At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell."
"It never went away, so I had to return it."
"PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big."
"The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out."
THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
It’s very small..
Received the travel money belt and it a lot smaller than the pictures shows.
I wished I did not buy it and will still have to look for something larger.
"Good umbrella, would buy it again if I had to"
"First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee."
"A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you."
"But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality."
Probably best umbrella I’ve had.
"Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp."
Packaging is terrible - received 3 damaged guitars
Very nice looking guitar.
Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product.
Don’t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged.
We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also.
Gave up.
They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box.
No padding at all.
Cool concept!
Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product
Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing.
I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests.
I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch.
It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone.
"For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder."
"Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out."
There's no music in the mic itself though.
It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic.
Or you can even sync your Spotify app.
Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately.
The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!)
and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room.
Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic.
"If you've figured this out, I'd love to know!"
2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky.
I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker.
"3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting."
"If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable."
Ribbed off by Vision Supplies
"October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost."
"Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay."
"Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages."
The plastic a missing on both.
Told warranty expired!!!!
Who would check every single cartridge when received????
BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
"I'm sorry, what?"
"My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk."
I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable.
"You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell?"
Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this.
You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell.
"My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries."
I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough.
I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients.
I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
Drops internet
I bought this modem/router about two years ago.
At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet.
This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired.
The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset.
This was happening once or twice a day.
"Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level."
Same problem.
The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem.
"Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions."
I had to do a factory reset to restore this.
I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences.
I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router.
It’s fantastic.
I’v Had it for over a week with no problems.
It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris.
I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast.
If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router.
"Get the Netgear, its much more reliable."
but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box.
"The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on."
"Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point."
The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times...
"They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying."
"On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop."
Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Ok case with serious limitations
"This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max."
The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen.
"Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues."
"The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand."
The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments.
I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation.
"This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy."
"Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen."
"The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen."
"This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees."
This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.
"This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice."
Everything I needed
This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs.
I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera.
The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA).
But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.
"Ok, needs some improvement."
A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote.
Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean.
As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out.
Also the range is a bit inconsistent.
I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work.
And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog.
Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while.
I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.
You get what you pay for.
"Horrible product, misrepresented"
"I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it."
"First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual."
"Second, it doesn't come with a charger."
"Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer."
"Fine, we have lots of those around."
"When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out."
"I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges."
"Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed."
"Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning."
"I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later."
"Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for..."
Great backpack but overkill on the straps
This backpack looks good and performs well.
It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days.
The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps.
There’s more straps on this bag than I can count.
I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag.
Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college.
There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided.
The flag also is a great finish to it
My dog hasnt destroyed it yet
Have had probs with Hockey Balls.
My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float.
That is until she chews them to bits.
"Tried several, even the ""hot weather"" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others."
Until these showed up.
These have stood the test.
My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews.
"Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog."
Thumbs up from Daisy and I.
This product is hazardous to children.
This is a huge health hazard to your baby.
We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go.
The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them.
"Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well."
Please do not buy this product.
I’m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.
overheating issues and hard time connecting controller
"Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot."
Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say.
I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one.
However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful.
I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one.
I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase.
I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.
I only have good things to say about this gift bag
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set.
"I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper."
The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift!
I highly recommend it.
The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive.
He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product.
5 stars all the way around!
The physics are terrible and the people that created the game won't do anything about it
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game.
Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy
Not like other tomb raider games
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games.
Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take.
Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways.
Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense.
I have not enjoyed this game.
I do not plan on finishing it.
The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.
"Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use"
"It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller."
The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker.
2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly.
We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year.
"So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase."
"The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls."
You get what you pay for
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic.
It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap.
"For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me."
I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it.
I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that.
"However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you."
It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
"Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT."
"I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus."
"Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it."
"Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did."
"Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves."
"When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that."
This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful.
I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account.
I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone.
I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit.
I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone.
Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST.
"On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it."
